With iBouquiniste you\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'ll quickly find what you\'re looking for in the Author\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? Whether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! From Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! The app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!

Our app enables you to record, retain, and retrieve names and people whenever and wherever you are. It makes a person feel good to hear their own name, and they pay more attention.  Research shows that hearing our name activates our brain, even when in a noisy room.  Influential leaders will make it a point to use people\'s names, and even to mention personal details that they share in common. They do this intentionally because they know it matters.  We feel better when people remember us, and worse when they don\'t.  When you forget someone\'s name, they feel that they (and their business!) are not important to you.It is no exaggeration that business deals often fail because someone failed to remember the right name at the right time.  In the age of email and online relationships, being able to use someone\'s name in a face-to-face meeting can set you apart. We intuitively know this, and yet without conscious effort, name recall is an elusive skill.  To make matters worse, this skill worsens after middle-age unless we train ourselves to remember.Who\'s Who has an option for spaced repetition.  This is a cognitive phenomenon where people recall information better when studied a few times over a long period of time than when studied many times over a short period.  If crammed memories are not refreshed, they are likely to decay to nothing.  If you enable reminders on the name that you enter, you will be sent a simple notification with the new name at increasingly long intervals.  You can turn reminders off easily at any time.Personal details such as hobbies or children\'s names can assist in memory recall.  Our memories are more like stories than items in a spreadsheet, and associating interesting tidbits with the name will actually help in recalling it. It is also useful to record when and where you met, not only because that data could be useful, but also it helps fill in the story that aids in memory recall. Our app has several optional fields for entering extraneous details for those very important contacts.  All of these fields can be searched in case you are trying to remember the name of the lady from "Hawaii" or the man who was an avid "baseball" fan.Memory experts often use mnemonics, word play, and outright whimsical visualizations. Think "Joe from Jersey," "Suzy sales," or "Richard the rich guy."   You might picture Roseanne holding a bouquet of roses, or Nancy wearing fancy pants.  Shirley drinking a Shirley Temple. If you are so inclined, our app has a "hint" field to capture your creative associations. The hint is revealed on demand in the Quiz, so that you can practice active recall testing.  Research has shown that active recall testing is far more effective at building strong memories than passive study.Most importantly, you must decide to make remembering names a priority.  The primary reason we have a problem remembering names is that we\'re not focused on learning it.  We have a lot of information competing for our attention, much of it more immediately important than a name.  Once you make the decision consciously to remember names because you care about the people you are interacting with, you immediately become much better at it.  Remember, people feel good when you remember their name, and worse when you don\'t.', '0')

Stick Pick suggests question starters for learners at different levels and also records how well students respond during classroom discussions. If a student is consistently scoring near the top or bottom, simply change the level so students aren\'t bored or frustrated. Depending on students\' levels of English proficiency, they might be asked simple yes-or-no questions or to elaborate in longer sentences.-----------------------------------------------DIFFERENTIATE INSTRUCTION-----------------------------------------------Stick Pick is the first app of its kind to uniquely link question stems to the cognitive or linguistic needs of each individual learner. Teachers can have multiple soup cans (classes) filled with sticks (students). During setup, teachers choose a category of question stems they wish to focus on for each learner. Questions can be based on Bloom\'s Taxonomy, English as a second language (ESL) skills, and degree of difficulty can be chosen for each learner. -----------------------------------------------TRACK FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT DATA-----------------------------------------------Formative assessment data is easy to track because teachers can tap a corresponding correct, incorrect, or opinion button based on the student\'s answer. Teachers can also rate each student\'s answer by selecting 0-5 on a critical thinking rubric (Bloom\'s) or an elaboration rubric (ESL). -----------------------------------------------EQUITY FOR ALL!-----------------------------------------------Stick Pick is a handy tool for any teacher device and can guide classroom discussion in really helpful ways. Teachers can mark sticks so they aren\'t constantly calling on the same students or asking students the same questions over and over again. Students in small groups can use Stick Pick, too. During small group work, students can take turns asking one another questions based on Bloom\'s Taxonomy, making group work more productive and on-task. -----------------------------------------------IMPROVE PARENT-SCHOOL COMMUNICATION-----------------------------------------------Student progress is recorded and averaged automatically within the app and can be shared in lots of convenient ways.-----------------------------------------------MANY SMART FEATURES-----------------------------------------------Finally -- no more sticks cluttering your desk! Now you can keep all your students’ sticks in one convenient place: on your mobile device!• Create as many classes as you need• Over 140 question stems categorized into three modes: Bloom’s; Bloom’s Revised; and ESL (English as a Second Language)• Copy an entire class, with or without scores• “Swipe up,” “tap,” or “shake” to call on a student• Level-appropriate question stems appear right on the screen• Option to operate in Stick Only mode• Sticks can be reset (put back in with the rest) or marked “used” in a special “used can”• Toggle between used and unused sticks with a single tap• Option to “peek” into each can to deliberately pick a particular student • Operates in Left or Right Hand mode• Collect formative assessment data using “Correct,” “Incorrect,” and “Opinion” buttons• Rate each learner\'s response on a 0-5 point rubric: use the Critical Thinking Rubric (for Bloom’s & Bloom’s Revised mode); or Degree of Elaboration Rubric (for ESL mode)• Share student data', '0')

"It\'s ok to write yet another graphing app, so long as it is the best one. And this is" -- Review by RightyC1 It features a simple, yet intuitive interface that makes it easy to enter and/or edit equations and visualize them in mathematical notation. It\'s also capable of displaying explicit and implicit equations as well as inequalities in both 2D and 3D, in all standard coordinate systems: cartesian, polar, spherical and cylindrical, all with amazing speed and beautiful results, which can be copied, emailed or saved to the photo library. It also includes an evaluate feature, in order to evaluate equations at specific points, as well as a library where you can store commonly used equations. Quick Graph+ differs from the free Quick Graph in that it already includes the advanced feature set which gives you access to all the features, such as implicit graphs and tracing. Keep in mind that for explicit graphs, you need to specify the dependent variable, since just typing "x^2" without the y=, will assume the expression to be "x^2=0" and it will be displayed as an implicit graph. Features: - Unlimited graphs.- VGA Output.- 2D - 3D equation plotting. - Library for commonly used equations. - Wireframe and solid visualization. - Support for cartesian, polar, cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems. - Pinch to zoom. - Drag to rotate - move. - Swipe to delete equations from the equation list. - Shake to reset view to original state, or to clear entry fields. - Double tap to change visualization modes. - Enhanced 2D mode for great hi-res graphics. - Adaptive 2D algorithms. - Enhanced 3D mode with better graphics. - In-app email so you can share graphics and equations. - Save to photo library. - Copy to clipboard. - Enhanced equation visualization. - Hyperbolic and Inverse functions. - Special functions such as Min, Max, if. - Interactive expression evaluation. - Implicit graphs and inequalities.- 2D tracing.- 2D independent axis scaling.- Labels and notes for library entries- Roots and Intersections- Value Table- Turn graphs on/off.We\'d love to hear your comments or suggestions, please drop us a line to info@kzlabs.me', '0')

The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.”--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime “First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.”--Common Sense Media “Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long?  Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.”--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u "First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, \'Leo loves First Words because it\'s fun and easy.

If you have a bird feeder it\'s likely you\'ve seen this beautiful red-breasted bird. Robins usually have black or brown heads and backs, but boast a bright red to orange chest that makes them easy to spot! Male and female robins look similar, though the males tend to be more brightly colored than their female counterparts. While these birds do migrate south in the winter, they can typically be found throughout most of the United States year-round. Aside from their bright red chest, robins are also known for another color - the color of their eggs! Robin eggs are a unique blue color that has been named "robin\'s egg blue".Robins are often heard early in the morning, greeting the dawn with their song even before other birds begin to sing. These worm-eating birds might even be the inspiration behind the common saying, "the early bird gets the worm"! Robins sing a cheery whistling song comprised of roughly ten notes in repeated syllables. Robins also use various other calls to communicate, from soft cucks to alarmed peeps! Robins even make a vocalization that sounds like laughter!Hear various robin songs and calls that will help you identify these birds by sound!

Sorts existing records by the moon sign. Additional logic and information for cases with unknown birth time.What is the Moon Sign?Most people know their "star sign", but it\'s not the same. In fact, "star sign" is a misnamed Sun Sign, the sign of the Zodiac where the Sun was located at the moment of a person\'s birth. Sun Sign is an important astrological characteristic, and in most cases it can be easily figured out from one\'s date of birth. Most probably, you already know what is your Sign of the Zodiac. That\'s your Sun Sign.Now, here is a surprise for you: you also have a Moon Sign which is not less important than the Sun Sign, and in certain cases can be even more important. Typically, your Moon Sign is different from your Sun Sign, but for some people they can be the same. Astronomically, Moon Sign is the Sign of the Zodiac where the Moon was located at the moment of your birth.So why nobody knows their Moon Sign? That\'s because you can\'t easily figure it out from the date of birth, like you can do with the Sun Sign. It takes some complex astronomical calculations to find out one\'s Moon Sign.Fortunately, this app is more than happy to do for you all the complex calculations in a split of a second, just tell it the date and time of birth, as well as the location where the person was born. If the time of birth is unknown, the app will either tell you that the Moon Sign is certain anyway, as the Moon remained in the same sign on the date of birth, or it will inform you which two signs are possible candidates, and which part of the day belongs to each of them. You can then decide which of the signs is the most appropriate by reading their descriptions.The new version of the app offers a new user interface where all the records you’ve saved are sorted and grouped by the Moon Sign.', '0')

MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTORI’ve been a believer my whole life, I’ve attended Christian schools my whole life, and I’ve heard the stories of Jesus countless times. I’ve also seen every Jesus movie and miniseries ever made, and there have been dozens. So why a new TV show about Jesus?Because I have a passion for people to hear the “old, old story” again … for the very first time. When I see Jesus movies, it’s sometimes hard for me to feel moved or excited. I\'ve heard the stories before, and many Jesus projects just take you from Bible story to Bible story, not spending as much time on the humanity and backstories of all these characters. And they sometimes feel stiff and formal.So when we started to write a show that explores Jesus through the eyes of those around Him, we were repeatedly moved and excited. We explored the backstories of Simon Peter, Matthew, Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, and a few of Jesus’ miracle recipients, and in turn experienced Him in the way they did. We couldn’t help but identify with their recklessness, rough pasts, religious piety, and desperation for life change. And ultimately, their redemption.One of our favorite responses from an early screening? "The story of Jesus that actually appealed to my teenagers!"No matter where you’re at in your journey with Christ—whether you’re one of the many people in the gospels who encountered Jesus after a horrific past without Him, or you’re a Nicodemus who’s been a lifelong member of the God team—Jesus proved over and over that we have so much to learn and innumerable traits that need change.We hope this show allows you to see Jesus as they did.

This is your "target".Step #2: use the camera to take a movie or picture of, for example, yourself smiling and waving. This is your "swap".Step #3: move the camera to bring your "target" book cover into view and WizPix replaces it with the "swap" movie.Now instead of seeing the book cover you see yourself smiling and waving.Does WizPix Work On Anything?For the "target" image, any flat surface without any glare works just fine.Great examples are:  book cover, magazine cover, framed art work on the wall, a physical photo in your hand, poster on a wall, etc.Bad examples are: framed pictures behind glass, shiny objects with light glare, 3D objects like balls, vases, water bottles, etc.The "swap" image can be a movie from your camera, a photo from your camera, or a photo/movie from your Photos App.', '0')

To date, we have successfully helped our customers liquidate millions of dollars in prepaid cards and gift cards.DON’T LET YOUR PREPAID CARDS GO TO WASTEPrepaid cards and gift cards are restrictive and full of fees. Hidden monthly fees and online shopping restrictions significantly limit access to money on your prepaid cards. Physical prepaid cards and gift cards also lack any loss or theft protection. If you lose your card, you lose your money—it’s that simple. Consumers don’t realize that most prepaid card and gift card owners never end up redeeming the full balance of their card. Don’t fall into the fee trap—get cash for your prepaid cards and gift cards today!

Great and fast service with reasonable prices. I love this site and I would definitely recommend it to friends.""Prepaid cards can be a hassle to use. They often just end up in a drawer. This is a convenient way to use any prepaid cards that you have laying around."ABOUT PREPAID2CASHPrepaid2Cash was founded by two financial technology entrepreneurs and is based in Birmingham, AL. The founders frequently received rebate and award gift cards from buying goods online and could not find any way to redeem the cards for cash. After experiencing this consumer pain point first hand, they partnered with leading banking and payments institutions to offer a simple and fast service to help consumers redeem their unwanted prepaid cards. The company and service came to be known as Prepaid2Cash, which was officially launched to the public in early 2016.Prepaid2Cash is an agent of Evolve Bank & Trust.

The effects could be serious – you want the steak medium but it’s still dripping blood. Or your anticipated rare steak is overdone and tough as leather.But, it doesn’t have to be that way. The Steak Master is easy to use and will help you cook your steaks just as you like them every time.The perfect preparation of steaks with the Steak Master is simple:1. First, you determine the type of temperature scale on your oven’s temperature control knob by tapping on the configuration button. That is important, because the Steak Master needs this information in order to give you the correct oven temperature later on. You only have to do this once per oven.2. Decide if you want to use just a frying pan or both frying pan and oven (the professional way). Using only the frying pan is much quicker than the use of frying pan and oven. The meat never leaves the pan until it’s done, whereas the slightly longer expert’s way requires both frying pan and oven, but results in perfectly juicy steaks.  3. Most important: The thickness of the steak and how you would like to have your steak . The Steak Master helps you to define both. Just tap on the pictures or the controller under the pictures and select how well done you would like to have your steak. Then tap on „Thickness of steak“, hold the steak sideways next to your iPhone/iPod and measure its thickness with your index finger.4. Here we go! The Steak Master guides you step by step through the menu, tells you what you need and shows you what to do in chronological order. For example how much you have to heat up the butter/oil in your frying pan.5. When your butter/oil is slightly bubbling it’s time to sear the steak. The Steak Master counts down the time before you have to turn over the steak.6. After searing your meat you just follow the instructions the Steak Master is giving you. Did you choose the cooking with the frying pan, reduce the heat to the temperature the Steak Master states on the display and simply finish the cooking in the pan. How long you have to cook and how often you have to turn the meat – the Steak Master-App has got the answer! A small treat are the Steak-Spy and the Steak-O-Meter:  they show you the condition and the progress of the steak during the cooking phase until it‘s finished. Then take the meat out of the pan, wrap it up with tin foil and let it rest. How long? The Steak Master tells you automatically.7. If you decided to use a frying pan and the oven it’s the same method, only that you have to follow the additional instructions of the Steak-Master-App for the use of the oven. Either way you choose – the result is a perfectly cooked steak and a great meal. Enjoy!Highlights- The Steak-Master calculates from the thickness of the steak and the chosen steak result (e.g. rare or medium) exactly to the second the time the steak needs to cook.- The formula is based on hundreds of tests by experienced steak experts.- Fool-proof preparation: simply determine thickness of the steak, the way you would like to have the steak done and follow the illustrated instructions of the App step by step.- The Steak Spy shows you the inside of the steak during the cooking progress.', '0')

Electric RC Sim is a flight simulator for radio controlled aircraft. Fast startup plus realistic physics and graphics make it a pleasure to fly.

If (when) you crash, just press the reset button and you\'re flying again. There\'s no need to fuss with building, repairing, or waiting for a calm day, saving you time and money.Includes: * two drones: simulates 4 motors, 3 axis gyro, PID controllers. Practice flips! * all my favourite aircraft: two trainers, a slow flyer, an aerobatic plane and a flying wing * aerobatic plane: learn to perform moves such as knife edging, snap rolls, ground loops * P-51 for some scale flying fun * ducted fan jet with massive control surfaces: crazy fast and crazy fun.

I was hesitant to practice, fearing causing damage to the flyer or persons/animals. I found this app which allows simulated flying in a safe environment with the exact controls my particular model used. After a couple days with the app I was able to fly the real thing with confidence, and within a week was completing flips, spins, fast direction changes, and expert maneuvers. I can\'t recommend this program enough.""What a great training tool... Superb stall and flight control simulation. Love the wind...""Most realistic rc sim at the moment!! ... novice to experienced will enjoy""Portrait view is a great idea, and the camera zoom works perfectly. UI is simple and to the point...""Once I heard the word \'flips\'... Awesome"Check out "Electric RC Sim Lite" if you\'d prefer to try before you buy.

Back the Kickstarter.NEWS FLASH! - the Manic Miner® app - a perfectly formed replica of the much-loved home computer game, with 3D voxel-style graphics - AVAILABLE NOWSearch the App Store for “the Manic Miner® app”.IMPORTANT: To \'Save\' the game go \'Back\' to the Main Menu before quitting the App.Jet Set Willy for the ZX Spectrum (an 8-bit personal home computer released in the UK in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd, which sold in excess of 5 million units worldwide) is one of THE defining games of the 1980s.Jet Set Willy: ZX Spectrum is offered as an in-app purchase from within the Recreated ZX Spectrum app. The Recreated ZX Spectrum app includes more ZX Spectrum games plus Sinclair BASIC.Jet Set Willy: ZX Spectrum is also available in this stand-alone form. It does not include any other ZX Spectrum games but it does include an infinite-lives version.Jet Set Willy: ZX Spectrum is the 100% original ZX Spectrum game, written in 1984 and is brought to you - as an officially licenced product - utilizing our ZX Spectrum: Elite Collection technology.Featuring:- portrait and landscape play / display modes- iDaptive (user-definable, game-specific joystick, keypad & canvas) Controls- ‘auto save’, on exiting the game- authentic \'Spectrum\' soundJet Set Willy was published in 1984 by Software Projects. The game is a sequel to Manic Miner (1983), and is the second game in the immensely popular Miner Willy Series. The Plot: A tired Miner Willy  has to tidy up all the items left around his house after a huge party. With this done his housekeeper Maria will allow him access to his bedroom. Willy\'s mansion was bought with the wealth obtained from his adventures in Manic Miner  but much of it remains unexplored and it appears to be full of strange creatures, possibly a result of the previous (missing) owner\'s experiments. Willy must explore the enormous mansion and its grounds (including a beach and a yacht) to fully tidy up the house so he can get some much-needed sleep. Game-play: Willy moves from room to room in his mansion collecting objects. Unlike the screen-by-screen style of its prequel, the player can explore the mansion at will and tackle the screens in the order of their choosing. Willy is controlled using only left, right and jump. He can climb stairs by walking into them (jumping through them to avoid them) and climb swinging ropes by pushing left or right depending on what direction the rope is swinging in. The play area itself consists of 60 flick-screen  making-up the mansion and its grounds and containing hazards (static killer objects), patrolling monsters (killer guardians which move along predetermined paths), various platforms and collectable objects. The collectable items glow to distinguish them from other items in the room. Willy loses a life if he touches an enemy or falls too far, and he is returned to the point at which he entered the room. This may lead to a game-ending situation in which Willy repeatedly falls from a height, losing all lives in succession. Bugs: As originally released, the game could not be completed due to several bugs. Although actually four completely unrelated issues, they became known collectively as "The Attic Bug". After the player entered the room The Attic, various rooms would undergo corruption on all subsequent game plays, including all monsters disappearing from The Chapel, and other screens triggering instant death. Initially Software Projects attempted to pass off this bug off as an intentional feature to make the game more difficult, claiming that the rooms in question were filled with poison gas. However, they later rescinded this claim and issued a set of POKEs to correct the flaws.About Elite®: Elite Systems Ltd was incorporated in England in 1984.', '0')

A player will have to roll a 6 before he or she is able to navigate a colored piece from its starting point to the starting square. After that, in each of the subsequent turns the player navigates a piece forward for one to six squares as indicated by the dice roll.When a 6 is rolled, the player may choose to advance a token already in play, or may enter another staged token to its starting square. Rolling a 6 earns the player an additional or "bonus" roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a 6 again, the player earns an additional bonus roll. If the third roll is also a 6, the player has to forfeit his/her turn which then passes to the next player. In cases where the player has rolled a six, the player may also choose to separate the chances if both pieces are active. For example, he or she can navigate one piece by 6 houses and another piece by 4 houses. Conversely, both the chances can be played using one single piece only; i.e. the player may navigate one piece for 6+4=10 houses.Players may not end their move on a square they already occupy. If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent\'s token, the opponent token is returned to its owner\'s yard. The returned token can be re-entered into play only when the owner rolls a 6. A player\'s home column squares are always safe.When a piece has navigated the board, it proceeds up the home column. A piece can only be moved onto the home pocket by an exact roll. The first player to move all 4 pieces into the home pocket wins.Get ready for the crazy adventure Ludo All Star is going to take you to, with it’s best ever in-game features.Download Ludo All Star now!

In 8-Ball, there are two opposing sets of 7 balls and one black ball (the 8-Ball). Of the 15 balls on the table (not counting the cue ball) the first 7 balls, which are numbered 1-7, are solid in color, while the remaining 7 balls, numbered 9-15, are stripped. One player makes all of his 7 balls, followed by the 8-Ball, at which point he is declared the winner of the game.Unlike 8-ball, 9 ball uses only 9-ball, and the cue ball includes all of the solid colored ball and the striped 9-ball. In 9-ball, players must shoot at the balls in numerical order, starting with the 1-ball and continuing until all 9 balls have been sunk. Mostly, the game of 9-ball can be ended soon if it calls “combination shot”, in which a player hits the next ball in order - "say the 3-ball" - into the 9-ball and pots 9-ball the hole.Follow us and regularly update event on the fan page:◽ Fanpage: https://www.facebook.com/8balllegendgame◽ Inbox: http://m.me/8balllegendgame', '3+')

The term may also refer to a Vietnamese card game, Thirteen (card game). Chinese Poker also is known as "Thirteen cards" is a card game based on poker hand rankings. In Chinese Poker, each player receives a 13-card hand from a standard 52-card deck. Each player then has to divide their cards into three poker hands (known as "setting"): two containing five cards each (known as "the middle" and "the back"), and one containing three cards ("the front"); the back must be the highest-ranking hand, and the front, the lowest-ranking hand (note that straights and flushes do not count in the three-card hand). The backhand is placed face down on the table in front of the player, then the middle hand is placed face down in front of the backhand, and the front hand is placed face down in front of the middle hand. After all the players have set their hands, each player will announce in turn (clockwise, starting from the left of the dealer) whether or not they are playing their hand. All players then announce their royalties, before revealing their hands.If a player makes three flushes or three straights they automatically win the hand, regardless of the other players\' hands. As shown in the photo, the middle player has made all three hands flush and is an automatic winner.The rules are simple—only a basic knowledge of poker hand rankings is needed to get started. There is a large element of luck involved, therefore a beginner has a good chance of winning in the short term, even against experienced opponents. The game format results in frequent unexpected wins and high-ranking hands.', '3+')

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called "the Turtle". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans.As any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package.A tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.Don\'t forget to check our Game section for other fun games...', '0')

If you enjoy Risk, Carcassonne, Go, Stratego, or even Uno or Solitaire, you will love the “easy-to-learn, hard-to-master” fun of this game. @ 148 Apps: “It’s addicting, a pleasure to play, and has earned a permanent spot on my device.”@ App Advice: “It is heavy on strategy, but light on rules... you will be guaranteed endless amounts of fun.” @ Pocket Tactics: “Totems manages to challenge some of the basic assumptions of strategy gaming with it’s all-or-nothing take on territory control, while still being simple enough to learn in an afternoon. For that alone, it deserves to plant its standard on your iDevice’s shores.”  Score: 5 of 5! @ App Store: Featured by Apple in "Best New Games!"GAME DESCRIPTIONThe game design is derived from the world-famous “4-Color Map Theorem”. The randomness of the totems in your ‘hand’, the changing colors of the territories, the variety of the maps, and the cleverness of your opponents will all conspire to make each turn a fun and interesting challenge. The object of the game is to place carved animal pieces (totems) on the map in order to claim territories. Each turn you will place matching totems on adjacent territories to expand your control of the map. The player who conquers the most territories when the map is full, wins. A game of Totems can be finished super-quickly or slowly, depending on your skills and your approach. GAME FEATURES ===> Offline and Online Game Modes Match wits against computer-controlled characters. Take on your friends in Multi-player mode over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

That\'s right, draw a second time!  You\'ll have to pay the same amount as your original wager and you\'ll have to give up whatever winnings you won on the first draw. But, any winnings from the second draw you keep! So, if you have 4 cards to a Royal Flush, you can draw again to try to get it! How fun is that?!? Another unique feature are the "Gold Cards". You collect Gold Cards by playing the game or purchasing them. After you have drawn your cards (possibly twice), you can use a Gold Card to replace a single card with ANY card you want!

For example, what\'s the value of:16% * 20%We’ve added a “Math” help button to show you how to calculate this in your head. One way is, 20% means one-fifth. One-fifth of 16% is (16% / 5), which is a little more than 3%. 3.2% to be exact. Or, convert to decimals, multiply, then convert back to %age\'s.(2)This app uses specific hand situations, and some people don’t see the value in this because in real life play we don’t know our opponents’ cards. There’s still value in specific hand situations, because they’re the building blocks that we can use to put together and estimate the odds for more complex hand range situations. For example every good player should know the odds for specific hand situations like AJ vs. QQ pre-flop, or FlushDraw vs. TopPair on the flop. Our other apps e.g. PokerCruncher handle both specific hands and hand ranges.**********"... helps players learn some of the math behind poker ... teaches a general method of estimating odds for different Texas Hold\'em situations."  -- PokerSoftware.comMany more great reviews from poker experts, pros, and coaches, and on our TwoPlusTwo forum thread.(See our website.)*****Poker trainers, odds tables, etc. are useful tools but do they help you learn why the odds are what they are or are you just memorizing specific situations? And you can\'t use these tools or odds calculators in the middle of a live hand (would you really want to?; could be a “fish” tell :)). This app takes a new and different approach to poker odds - understanding instead of memorizing, so you can handle any situation that comes your way.Our odds estimation method is a pretty simple 3-step procedure. First you count your outs and estimate your odds of improving (using for example the "Rule of 4&2"; this app shows you how). Then you consider your opponent\'s counter-outs. Then you put the two together to come up with a good odds estimate.We\'ve provided about 20 common and important pre-flop and post-flop scenarios for you to practice the method on. This app will take you through the 3 steps for each practice scenario, one screen per step, and will make sure that you\'re on track towards a good odds estimate each step of the way, correcting you if needed. We\'ve provided info/help buttons for each sub-step.You might be thinking, how can you cover a game as complex as Texas Hold\'em in 20 scenarios? Well, we agree, you can\'t! But this app is about learning a general method not many specific situations, and we picked these 20 scenarios to cover a good cross-section of common and important pre-flop and post-flop situations. If you understand how to calculate the odds for say one generic TopPair vs TopPairTopKicker scenario or one representative Pair vs LowerPair pre-flop scenario, you\'ll be able to apply your knowledge to other similar situations easily.Now, we\'re not saying that you\'re going to master this in 5 or 10 minutes. You\'re going to have to practice the method more than a few times, think about the outs and counter-outs, and do simple math operations in your head - basic +, -, *, /; let\'s not let our math teachers down :). We hope you feel that acquiring this odds skill and knowledge is more than worth the learning/practice time.*****See our website for our strong free app update history over many years.Follow us on Facebook and Twitter.*****App Store reviews are greatly appreciated, thank you.*****Also please check out our companion apps Hold’em Odds Quizzer and PokerCruncher.*****', '0')

The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW) says "So, what\'s better about Set Pro HD than either the earlier Set app or a deck of Set cards. Well, pretty much everything.....". See http://www.tuaw.com/2010/08/13/app-review-set-pro-hd/. The SET game has won over 35 Best Game Awards. SET Pro HD enables you to find SETs at the speed of your brain. Using two hands you have the same speed advantage as you do in typing or playing the piano. The sense of a really fast player is, in fact, that of a piano player (see the YouTube demo - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eo_kY__glY – boy does this guy have good brain connections!). The SET game is also enjoyed when played with others. In multi-player game play there are no turns in the game. Up to four people can simultaneously play all using both hands. SET Pro HD removes all previous electronic limitations in all of its play modes, making this realization of the SET game a joy to play.To find a SET you must recognize three cards on the gameboard of 12 cards in which each of the features, examined independently, are either the same on the 3 cards OR different on the 3 cards. That’s it. One rule. It is deceptively simple. Thus, it’s easy to learn. A 6 year old can do it. But it’s a challenge for life, and mastering it challenges college students and their professors. The game has two levels Basic and Advanced. All players, regardless of age need to learn using the Basic level. Once you get the idea down, move to the Advanced level where you will experience the depth and richness of the mental challenge of SET. The Advanced level is the complete SET game. Of course, since SET is a game for all ages, younger players may take longer to be able to play the full game.  Basic level has 3 features that anyone can master. Advanced level has four features, which is a challenge for all.When you want a challenge for just yourself, SET Pro HD includes 6 solitaire game modes, Classical SET, Rediscovery SET, Sprint SET, Marathon SET, Puzzle SET, and Arcade SET. In Classical SET play, SET Pro HD challenges you to get through the deck in the shortest time finding SETs. In Rediscovery SET you try to get 25 SETs in the shortest time, with the cards either being rearranged, or, with 3 cards randomly replaced every 10 seconds if you don’t find a SET. In Sprint SET you are challenged to get the most SETs in 60 or 90 seconds. You never run out of cards. In Marathon SET you must pace yourself to get the best scores. Puzzle SET challenges you to find 4 or 6 SETs in a fixed gameboard of cards. Arcade SET paces you as you play requiring you to find SETs faster and faster until you cry ‘uncle’. In all game modes you can play either Basic or Advanced Level.In multiplayer mode, players tap their scorecards to take control of the board, and then tap-in their SET, or, after tapping they can swipe their scorecard (or tap the NO-SET icon) to gain additional points if they perceive that a NO-SET situation exists. A point is lost if 3 cards are selected that don’t make a SET, or if a player doesn’t tap the cards within the time limit.For beginners, there is an interactive Tutorial, and Hints are provided in all the game modes. Players can choose to play in teams. Your scores can be kept in the STATS if you choose, and in STATS ALL your best scores and those of all your friends are ranked if players want to see their rankings.Additional help and Tutorials are provided on the website http://www.setgame.com', '0')

On every match, all players receive the same stack with cards in the same order and thus the intellect of the player is the only variable to determine who gets the win.While Poker is played in innumerable forms, a player who understands the values of the Poker hands and the principles of betting can play without difficulty in any type of Poker game. Except in a few versions of the game, a Poker hand consists of five cards. The various combinations of Poker hands rank from five of a kind (the highest) to no pair or nothing (the lowest):Five of a Kind – This is the highest possible hand and can occur only in games where at least one card is wild, such as a joker, the two one-eyed jacks, or the four deuces. Examples of five of a kind would be four 10s and a wild card or two queens and three wild cards.Straight Flush – This is the highest possible hand when only the standard pack is used, and there are no wild cards. A straight flush consists of five cards of the same suit in sequence, such as 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 of hearts. The highest-ranking straight flush is the A, K, Q, J, and 10 of one suit, and this combination has a special name: a royal flush or a royal straight flush. The odds on being dealt this hand are 1 in almost 650,000.Four of a Kind – This is the next highest hand, and it ranks just below a straight flush. An example is four aces or four 3s. It does not matter what the fifth, unmatched card is.Full House – This colorful hand is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three 8s and two 4s, or three aces and two 6s.Flush – Five cards, all of the same suit, but not all in sequence, is a flush. An example is Q, 10, 7, 6, and 2 of clubs.Straight – Five cards in sequence, but not all of the same suit is a straight.Three of a Kind – This combination contains three cards of the same rank, and the other two cards each of a different rank, such as three jacks, a seven, and a four.Two Pairs – This hand contains a pair of one rank and another pair of a different rank, plus any fifth card of a different rank, such as Q, Q, 7, 7, 4.One Pair – This frequent combination contains just one pair with the other three cards being of different rank. An example is 10, 10, K, 4, 3.No Pair – This very common hand contains "nothing." None of the five cards pair up, nor are all five cards of the same suit or consecutive in rank. When more than one player has no pair, the hands are rated by the highest card each hand contains, so that an ace-high hand beats a king-high hand, and so on.• Enjoy our different tournament modalities where you can access to much bigger rewards apart from economic prizes.- Head to Head.- Bracket Tournaments.- Live events.• Add any user as a friend and challenge him directly.

Texas 42 is a trick taking game similar to bridge or spades. Invented in the late 1880s, it has become a tradition across generations of players. The sole motivator for the development of this app has been to create an AI that doesn\'t make the users wish they spent their 2 dollars on a soda instead of frustrating computer play. Much work has been made into creating an AI that makes the same moves you would. Since you don\'t have the same play style as everyone else, you can set each computer player to have one of 3 specified play styles "Conservative", "Normal", or "Aggressive". You can mix and match these styles as you see fit and can change them at any time in the game. A conservative player will tend to bid lower than the rest of the players. Its main focus when it has the lead is to draw all the trumps in play before moving on to non-trumps. If the conservative player does not have the highest trump, it will tend to lead with a junk/punt tile to draw out the higher ones, while holding on to tiles with count until it knows it can win with them. A normal player will tend to bid higher than a conservative player. Its main focus is holding on to its trumps for cases where count is on the table. If it does not have the highest trump it will tend to attempt to punt to its teammate. An aggressive player is a mixture of the two. It tends to push the bid to 31 or 34-36 with weaker hands than the other two and is more willing to bid marks if it has a strong hand. It is also willing to lay down trumps with 5 counts in an effort to draw out the ones covering the 10 count. Its more willing to play count at risk of hoping its partner will win the trick. For bidding purposes, your partner will respond to your bid. If you bid 30, you are indicating to your partner that you have a helping hand and it will be much more likely to outbid an opponent win the bid. ----------------------------------------------------- Here\'s what some beta testers have had to say about the app: "The AI has been impressive for me so far, not a single play that I\'ve seen has been stupid yet and I\'ve probably played around 10 games. Very solid game for my experience" "I really like your idea of the different styles of play and I think you are pretty close to that reality." "To date it is the best one out there. I have never felt like I was playing true 42 on the other apps."', 3)

This is often called a clairvoyant ability, and can enhance your life in many surprising ways.The player is presented with four colored squares.  For each trial, one has been selected at random by the ESP Trainer.  Your task is to choose the correct square.  If you succeed, you will hear a chime, feel a vibration, and see a large color picture. Otherwise, the system lights up the correct square, and you proceed with the next trial.  The score indicator at the top counts the number of correct choices.  Words of encouragement appear as you achieve the scoring levels of 6, 8. 10, 12 or 14 hits.  After 24 trials you may begin a new game.The game offers multi-sensory feedback, reinforcement, and an opportunity to Pass, meeting all the requirements needed for learning this skill. ESP Trainer improves your ability to recognize your intuitive impressions, and it can bring you to a level of intuitive awareness beyond anything you\'ve experienced before.The purpose of the trainer is to allow you to become aware of what it feels like when you psychically choose the correct square.  When you don\'t have that special feeling, we encourage you to press the Pass button.  (So this is not a "forced choice" test.)In a year long NASA program with 145 subjects (under Contract 953653 NAS7-100) many were able to significantly improve their scores. Four of the subjects improved their scores at the hundred-to-one level or better. This approach has been used with surprising success on Wall Street. But of course, past results are no guarantee of future performance.Because you are learning a new skill, slower is better than faster. If you find yourself frequently scoring 12 or more, write to the developer at his web site www.espresearch.com.  This game can provide the first steps toward experiencing and developing the psychic abilities hidden within us all.software by Levity Novelty LLC', '0')

In locations where the dealer stands on a soft 17, or redoubling is allowed, Spanish Blackjack 21 may be a better bet than blackjack, depending on the specific blackjack rules. If you are looking for a change of pace from traditional blackjack but insist on a game with a low house edge, then you may find new excitement in Spanish Blackjack 21.Key feature: * Gorgeous HD graphics and slick, fast gameplay* Realistic sounds, and smooth animations* Fast and clean interface.* Offline playable: you dont need an internet connection to play this game, it run perfectly fine when offline* Constant playing: you don\'t need to wait for other player to play this game* Completely free: you don\'t need any money to play this game, the chips in the game are also free to get.Here are the full rules of the game.Spanish Blackjack 21 uses six or eight Spanish decks, each deck consisting of 48 cards — the regular 52 cards less the four tens. Any card counter can tell you that removing any 10-point card from the cards moves the odds in favor of the dealer. To make up for this, Spanish Blackjack 21 gives the player a host of bonuses and favorable rules. There are lots of Spanish Blackjack 21 games all over the country, so rules will vary somewhat from place to place, but the usual rules in the player\'s favor are:+ Late surrender allowed.+ Double after split allowed.+ Re-splitting aces allowed.+ A player 21 always wins.+ Player blackjack beats dealer blackjack.+ Player may double on any number of cards.+ Player may usually hit and double down after splitting aces.+ Player may surrender after doubling, known as "double down rescue." The player forfeits an amount equal to his original bet.+ A five-card 21 pays 3 to 2, a six-card 21 pays 2 to 1, a seven or more card 21 pays 3 to 1. Bonus not honored after doubling.+ A 6-7-8 or 7-7-7 of mixed suits pays 3 to 2, of the same suit pays 2 to 1, and of spades pays 3 to 1. These bonuses do not pay after doubling.+ Suited 7-7-7 when the dealer has a seven face up pays 1000 for bets of 5-24 and 5000 "Super Bonus" for bets of 25 or over. In addition, all other players receive a 50 "envy bonus." This bonus does not pay after doubling or splitting.Download Spanish blackjack 21 now for free!Blue Wind casinoBring the casino to your home', 3)

It won\'t tell you your odds of hitting a straight, or how many outs you have. It merely tells you where your pre-flop hand ranks - and your % chance of having the best hand on the flop. Yes, that\'s right - the flop, not the River. Why does it only tell you this? Because this is all you really need to know from a poker calculator. Any other numbers will only distract or mislead you. The biggest mistake other poker calculators make is they rank your hand by calculating your odds all the way to the River. But pre-flop, when you need to make a decision based on knowing only two cards, what you really want to know is how well you\'ll do on the FLOP. After the flop, there will be less players & more bluffing, and you\'ll need to rely more on instinct than math.That\'s why this little app is quick and to the point. "Pocket Odds" will simply tell you how strong your hand is, pre-flop. And it only takes three or four taps from you!So you may be wondering why you even need this program. After all, there are only 169 different starting hands in Holdem! This is true, but they "sort" quite a bit differently depending on the situation. How many opponents do you have? Are you looking to hit the flop, or wait to make your hand on the river?The truth is, hands act differently in different situations. Did you know that 10-9 suited turns into the top hand on the flop 48% more often against 8 players than it does heads-up? It\'s true! Additionally, hand strength is a bit different when looking at the flop instead of the river. For example, 7-2 off-suit, which is generally considered the worst starting hand in poker, averages better on the flop than 2-3, no matter how many opponents you have. In fact when "Heads-up", there are 16 hands that are worse "floppers" than 7-2 off."Pocket Odds" will tell you all this, instantly. (And discreetly - there is even a "vibrate" button so you can pretend you are getting an incoming text message!)Oh, and it will even tell you your odds of winning at the River, just in case you miss the other poker calculators :-)', '0')

Featuring:- portrait and landscape play / display modes- iDaptive (user-definable, game-specific joystick, keypad & canvass) Controls- (Google: "Tiny URL 22qh8hl") for more info- ‘auto save’, on exiting the game- authentic \'Spectrum\' soundManic Miner is a platform game originally written for the ZX Spectrum and released by Bug-Byte in 1983 (later re-released by Software Projects). It is the first game in the Miner Willy series and among the pioneers of the platform game genre. The game itself was inspired by the Atari 800 game Miner 2049er. It has since been ported to numerous home computers and video game consoles. At the time, its stand-out features included in-game music and sound effects, excellent playability, and colourful graphics, which were well designed for the graphical limitations of the ZX Spectrum. On the Spectrum this was the first game with in-game music, the playing of which required constant CPU attention and was thought impossible. It was cleverly achieved by constantly alternating CPU time between the music and the game (which accounts for the music\'s stuttery rhythm). The in-game music is In the Hall of the Mountain King from Edvard Grieg\'s music to Henrik Ibsen\'s play Peer Gynt. The music that plays during the title screen is an arrangement of An der schönen blauen Donau (popularly known as The Blue Danube), a waltz by Johann Strauß.Manic Miner for the ZX Spectrum contains the following 20 rooms:1. Central Cavern2. The Cold Room3. The Menagerie4. Abandoned Uranium Workings5. Eugene\'s Lair6. Processing Plant7. The Vat8. Miner Willy meets the Kong Beast9. Wacky Amoebatrons10. The Endorian Forest11. Attack of the Mutant Telephones12. Return of the Alien Kong Beast13. Ore Refinery14. Skylab Landing Bay15. The Bank16. The Sixteenth Cavern17. The Warehouse18. Amoebatrons\' Revenge19. Solar Power Generator20. The Final BarrierIn each of the twenty caverns are several flashing objects, which the player must collect before Willy\'s oxygen supply runs out. Once the player has collected the objects in one cavern, they must then go to the now-flashing portal, which will take them to the next cavern. The player must avoid enemies (listed in the cassette inlay) as Poisonous Pansies, Spiders, Slime, and Manic Mining Robots, which move backwards and forwards along a predefined length at constant speeds. Willy can also be killed by falling too far, so players must time the precision of jumps and other movements to prevent such falls or collisions with the enemies. The game ends when the player has no lives left; extra lives are gained every 10000 points.About Elite®: Elite Systems Ltd was incorporated in England in 1984.', '0')

Her kingdom was as large as it was magnificent, where every inhabitant was at peace, be it a super powerful gnome or tiny little fairy with powers to turn any boring old day into an unforgettable celebration. As the princess grew up, her advisors managed the kingdom before she came of age and was allowed to take the throne. Everyone knew of the young heiress\' beauty and splendor, but unfortunately, Layna was uninterested in the lives of her future subjects. She spent her days in worry-free joy, blissfully unaware of the responsibility of her future position. Finally her special day arrived! Nowhere in the kingdom was a single girl more stunning and exuberant than the princess, and nobody could imagine something could ever go wrong... The coronation was held in the sun-soaked throne room, music filled the air, and gallantly dressed members of the court greeted their future queen with smiling faces. It was as if in a fairytale dream, pure joy sent the princess\' head spinning, and she could hardly wait till she finally felt the weight of the crown upon her head. Then suddenly, the music stopped... Someone was flying through the crowd to the center of the room. Moments later, frightened to her core, Layna sees a witch before her. She had no idea what was going on. She couldn\'t even move a finger, almost as if she were under a spell. The uninvited guest\'s voice broke the deafening silence: ""You, who calls themselves the rightful heir to the throne, are you truly prepared to rule the kingdom and answer for the fate of your simple subjects?! You live in a world of luxury, have never known greif, and at any moment hundreds of hypocritical smiles are ready at your beck and call to bring whatever you so desire on a silver platter... Well then, so it shall be that no spoiled brat shall ever rule us!"" The witch flicked her wrist and a bright light flooded every inch of the throne room. Layna shut her eyes tight, and the floor disappeared... When the princess opened her eyes, she found herself on a haystack surrounded by endless fields instead of royal walls. A young man and his grandfather came rushing out of the nearby house to help her, but neither recognized the young girl as the future queen. Once Layna realized the evil witch\'s curse clouded the minds of her people, she resolved to hunt her down and prove she deserved to rule the kingdom! Find out if the princess ever manages to break the evil curse, or if the memory of princess Layna is destined to be forever forgotten!

This app supports FB2, EPUB, MOBI, PDF, DJVU, CBR, CBZ and TXT formats and offers adjustable fonts, paragraph indents, paper type and more. iBouquiniste gives you a reading experience that\'s as close as you can get to reading a real book, and it even lets you share your favorite books via email. Click "...More" to learn why you should download this App today!*** Featured In New and Newsworthy! ***Do you love to read? With iBouquiniste you\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'ll quickly find what you\'re looking for in the Author\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading. Download iBouquiniste now and have all of your books at your fingertips.', '3+')

Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? Whether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! From Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! The app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!

Our app enables you to record, retain, and retrieve names and people whenever and wherever you are. It makes a person feel good to hear their own name, and they pay more attention.  Research shows that hearing our name activates our brain, even when in a noisy room.  Influential leaders will make it a point to use people\'s names, and even to mention personal details that they share in common. They do this intentionally because they know it matters.  We feel better when people remember us, and worse when they don\'t.  When you forget someone\'s name, they feel that they (and their business!) are not important to you.It is no exaggeration that business deals often fail because someone failed to remember the right name at the right time.  In the age of email and online relationships, being able to use someone\'s name in a face-to-face meeting can set you apart. We intuitively know this, and yet without conscious effort, name recall is an elusive skill.  To make matters worse, this skill worsens after middle-age unless we train ourselves to remember.Who\'s Who has an option for spaced repetition.  This is a cognitive phenomenon where people recall information better when studied a few times over a long period of time than when studied many times over a short period.  If crammed memories are not refreshed, they are likely to decay to nothing.  If you enable reminders on the name that you enter, you will be sent a simple notification with the new name at increasingly long intervals.  You can turn reminders off easily at any time.Personal details such as hobbies or children\'s names can assist in memory recall.  Our memories are more like stories than items in a spreadsheet, and associating interesting tidbits with the name will actually help in recalling it. It is also useful to record when and where you met, not only because that data could be useful, but also it helps fill in the story that aids in memory recall. Our app has several optional fields for entering extraneous details for those very important contacts.  All of these fields can be searched in case you are trying to remember the name of the lady from "Hawaii" or the man who was an avid "baseball" fan.Memory experts often use mnemonics, word play, and outright whimsical visualizations. Think "Joe from Jersey," "Suzy sales," or "Richard the rich guy."   You might picture Roseanne holding a bouquet of roses, or Nancy wearing fancy pants.  Shirley drinking a Shirley Temple. If you are so inclined, our app has a "hint" field to capture your creative associations. The hint is revealed on demand in the Quiz, so that you can practice active recall testing.  Research has shown that active recall testing is far more effective at building strong memories than passive study.Most importantly, you must decide to make remembering names a priority.  The primary reason we have a problem remembering names is that we\'re not focused on learning it.  We have a lot of information competing for our attention, much of it more immediately important than a name.  Once you make the decision consciously to remember names because you care about the people you are interacting with, you immediately become much better at it.  Remember, people feel good when you remember their name, and worse when you don\'t.', '0')

Differentiate instruction while increasing  student attention!New in version 1.11: • Sync across all iOS devices via our new "Stick Pick Cloud" now with reliable Amazon Web Services on the back end - for free!• Sign in with either your Facebook or Google account• New Facebook and Google icons in App Settings• Various bug fixesJoin over 65,000 teachers, like EdTechChic, who says: "Say goodbye to your coffee can with popsicle sticks and say hello to Stick Pick!"Pick a student at random with just a tap, swipe, or a shake -- but that’s just the beginning. Stick Pick suggests question starters for learners at different levels and also records how well students respond during classroom discussions. If a student is consistently scoring near the top or bottom, simply change the level so students aren\'t bored or frustrated. Depending on students\' levels of English proficiency, they might be asked simple yes-or-no questions or to elaborate in longer sentences.-----------------------------------------------DIFFERENTIATE INSTRUCTION-----------------------------------------------Stick Pick is the first app of its kind to uniquely link question stems to the cognitive or linguistic needs of each individual learner. Teachers can have multiple soup cans (classes) filled with sticks (students). During setup, teachers choose a category of question stems they wish to focus on for each learner. Questions can be based on Bloom\'s Taxonomy, English as a second language (ESL) skills, and degree of difficulty can be chosen for each learner. -----------------------------------------------TRACK FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT DATA-----------------------------------------------Formative assessment data is easy to track because teachers can tap a corresponding correct, incorrect, or opinion button based on the student\'s answer. Teachers can also rate each student\'s answer by selecting 0-5 on a critical thinking rubric (Bloom\'s) or an elaboration rubric (ESL). -----------------------------------------------EQUITY FOR ALL!-----------------------------------------------Stick Pick is a handy tool for any teacher device and can guide classroom discussion in really helpful ways. Teachers can mark sticks so they aren\'t constantly calling on the same students or asking students the same questions over and over again. Students in small groups can use Stick Pick, too. During small group work, students can take turns asking one another questions based on Bloom\'s Taxonomy, making group work more productive and on-task. -----------------------------------------------IMPROVE PARENT-SCHOOL COMMUNICATION-----------------------------------------------Student progress is recorded and averaged automatically within the app and can be shared in lots of convenient ways.-----------------------------------------------MANY SMART FEATURES-----------------------------------------------Finally -- no more sticks cluttering your desk! Now you can keep all your students’ sticks in one convenient place: on your mobile device!• Create as many classes as you need• Over 140 question stems categorized into three modes: Bloom’s; Bloom’s Revised; and ESL (English as a Second Language)• Copy an entire class, with or without scores• “Swipe up,” “tap,” or “shake” to call on a student• Level-appropriate question stems appear right on the screen• Option to operate in Stick Only mode• Sticks can be reset (put back in with the rest) or marked “used” in a special “used can”• Toggle between used and unused sticks with a single tap• Option to “peek” into each can to deliberately pick a particular student • Operates in Left or Right Hand mode• Collect formative assessment data using “Correct,” “Incorrect,” and “Opinion” buttons• Rate each learner\'s response on a 0-5 point rubric: use the Critical Thinking Rubric (for Bloom’s & Bloom’s Revised mode); or Degree of Elaboration Rubric (for ESL mode)• Share student data', '0')

"It\'s ok to write yet another graphing app, so long as it is the best one. And this is" -- Review by RightyC1 It features a simple, yet intuitive interface that makes it easy to enter and/or edit equations and visualize them in mathematical notation. It\'s also capable of displaying explicit and implicit equations as well as inequalities in both 2D and 3D, in all standard coordinate systems: cartesian, polar, spherical and cylindrical, all with amazing speed and beautiful results, which can be copied, emailed or saved to the photo library. It also includes an evaluate feature, in order to evaluate equations at specific points, as well as a library where you can store commonly used equations. Quick Graph+ differs from the free Quick Graph in that it already includes the advanced feature set which gives you access to all the features, such as implicit graphs and tracing. Keep in mind that for explicit graphs, you need to specify the dependent variable, since just typing "x^2" without the y=, will assume the expression to be "x^2=0" and it will be displayed as an implicit graph. Features: - Unlimited graphs.- VGA Output.- 2D - 3D equation plotting. - Library for commonly used equations. - Wireframe and solid visualization. - Support for cartesian, polar, cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems. - Pinch to zoom. - Drag to rotate - move. - Swipe to delete equations from the equation list. - Shake to reset view to original state, or to clear entry fields. - Double tap to change visualization modes. - Enhanced 2D mode for great hi-res graphics. - Adaptive 2D algorithms. - Enhanced 3D mode with better graphics. - In-app email so you can share graphics and equations. - Save to photo library. - Copy to clipboard. - Enhanced equation visualization. - Hyperbolic and Inverse functions. - Special functions such as Min, Max, if. - Interactive expression evaluation. - Implicit graphs and inequalities.- 2D tracing.- 2D independent axis scaling.- Labels and notes for library entries- Roots and Intersections- Value Table- Turn graphs on/off.We\'d love to hear your comments or suggestions, please drop us a line to info@kzlabs.me', '0')

Memy lets you learn texts by heart ultra fast, by gradually hiding words or lines.How?Read the text aloud a few times, and then hit the "hide" button: a few random words will be blanked out. Your challenge is then to read aloud again, trying to remember the words that are hidden. If you can\'t, display more words again. But as soon as you can comfortably read the text, without any hesitation, hide more words to increase the difficulty and challenge your brain even more. Once no word is visible, you will know the text by heart!Since your brain only has to learn a few words at a time and the difficulty increases gradually, you\'ll be able to learn entire texts by focusing a few minutes -a task that might have taken you hours without this technique.Extra features:• Learn line by line: want to avoid memory lapses?

Male and female robins look similar, though the males tend to be more brightly colored than their female counterparts. While these birds do migrate south in the winter, they can typically be found throughout most of the United States year-round. Aside from their bright red chest, robins are also known for another color - the color of their eggs! Robin eggs are a unique blue color that has been named "robin\'s egg blue".Robins are often heard early in the morning, greeting the dawn with their song even before other birds begin to sing. These worm-eating birds might even be the inspiration behind the common saying, "the early bird gets the worm"! Robins sing a cheery whistling song comprised of roughly ten notes in repeated syllables. Robins also use various other calls to communicate, from soft cucks to alarmed peeps!

Sorts existing records by the moon sign. Additional logic and information for cases with unknown birth time.What is the Moon Sign?Most people know their "star sign", but it\'s not the same. In fact, "star sign" is a misnamed Sun Sign, the sign of the Zodiac where the Sun was located at the moment of a person\'s birth. Sun Sign is an important astrological characteristic, and in most cases it can be easily figured out from one\'s date of birth. Most probably, you already know what is your Sign of the Zodiac. That\'s your Sun Sign.Now, here is a surprise for you: you also have a Moon Sign which is not less important than the Sun Sign, and in certain cases can be even more important. Typically, your Moon Sign is different from your Sun Sign, but for some people they can be the same. Astronomically, Moon Sign is the Sign of the Zodiac where the Moon was located at the moment of your birth.So why nobody knows their Moon Sign? That\'s because you can\'t easily figure it out from the date of birth, like you can do with the Sun Sign. It takes some complex astronomical calculations to find out one\'s Moon Sign.Fortunately, this app is more than happy to do for you all the complex calculations in a split of a second, just tell it the date and time of birth, as well as the location where the person was born. If the time of birth is unknown, the app will either tell you that the Moon Sign is certain anyway, as the Moon remained in the same sign on the date of birth, or it will inform you which two signs are possible candidates, and which part of the day belongs to each of them. You can then decide which of the signs is the most appropriate by reading their descriptions.The new version of the app offers a new user interface where all the records you’ve saved are sorted and grouped by the Moon Sign.', '0')

MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTORI’ve been a believer my whole life, I’ve attended Christian schools my whole life, and I’ve heard the stories of Jesus countless times. I’ve also seen every Jesus movie and miniseries ever made, and there have been dozens. So why a new TV show about Jesus?Because I have a passion for people to hear the “old, old story” again … for the very first time. When I see Jesus movies, it’s sometimes hard for me to feel moved or excited. I\'ve heard the stories before, and many Jesus projects just take you from Bible story to Bible story, not spending as much time on the humanity and backstories of all these characters. And they sometimes feel stiff and formal.So when we started to write a show that explores Jesus through the eyes of those around Him, we were repeatedly moved and excited. We explored the backstories of Simon Peter, Matthew, Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, and a few of Jesus’ miracle recipients, and in turn experienced Him in the way they did. We couldn’t help but identify with their recklessness, rough pasts, religious piety, and desperation for life change. And ultimately, their redemption.One of our favorite responses from an early screening? "The story of Jesus that actually appealed to my teenagers!"No matter where you’re at in your journey with Christ—whether you’re one of the many people in the gospels who encountered Jesus after a horrific past without Him, or you’re a Nicodemus who’s been a lifelong member of the God team—Jesus proved over and over that we have so much to learn and innumerable traits that need change.We hope this show allows you to see Jesus as they did. The end of the trailer tells you how to watch this show right now.', '3+')

The effects could be serious – you want the steak medium but it’s still dripping blood. Or your anticipated rare steak is overdone and tough as leather.But, it doesn’t have to be that way. The Steak Master is easy to use and will help you cook your steaks just as you like them every time.The perfect preparation of steaks with the Steak Master is simple:1. First, you determine the type of temperature scale on your oven’s temperature control knob by tapping on the configuration button. That is important, because the Steak Master needs this information in order to give you the correct oven temperature later on. You only have to do this once per oven.2. Decide if you want to use just a frying pan or both frying pan and oven (the professional way). Using only the frying pan is much quicker than the use of frying pan and oven. The meat never leaves the pan until it’s done, whereas the slightly longer expert’s way requires both frying pan and oven, but results in perfectly juicy steaks.  3. Most important: The thickness of the steak and how you would like to have your steak . The Steak Master helps you to define both. Just tap on the pictures or the controller under the pictures and select how well done you would like to have your steak. Then tap on „Thickness of steak“, hold the steak sideways next to your iPhone/iPod and measure its thickness with your index finger.4. Here we go! The Steak Master guides you step by step through the menu, tells you what you need and shows you what to do in chronological order. For example how much you have to heat up the butter/oil in your frying pan.5. When your butter/oil is slightly bubbling it’s time to sear the steak. The Steak Master counts down the time before you have to turn over the steak.6. After searing your meat you just follow the instructions the Steak Master is giving you. Did you choose the cooking with the frying pan, reduce the heat to the temperature the Steak Master states on the display and simply finish the cooking in the pan. How long you have to cook and how often you have to turn the meat – the Steak Master-App has got the answer! A small treat are the Steak-Spy and the Steak-O-Meter:  they show you the condition and the progress of the steak during the cooking phase until it‘s finished. Then take the meat out of the pan, wrap it up with tin foil and let it rest. How long? The Steak Master tells you automatically.7. If you decided to use a frying pan and the oven it’s the same method, only that you have to follow the additional instructions of the Steak-Master-App for the use of the oven. Either way you choose – the result is a perfectly cooked steak and a great meal. Enjoy!Highlights- The Steak-Master calculates from the thickness of the steak and the chosen steak result (e.g. rare or medium) exactly to the second the time the steak needs to cook.- The formula is based on hundreds of tests by experienced steak experts.- Fool-proof preparation: simply determine thickness of the steak, the way you would like to have the steak done and follow the illustrated instructions of the App step by step.- The Steak Spy shows you the inside of the steak during the cooking progress.', '0')

Back the Kickstarter.NEWS FLASH! - the Manic Miner® app - a perfectly formed replica of the much-loved home computer game, with 3D voxel-style graphics - AVAILABLE NOWSearch the App Store for “the Manic Miner® app”.IMPORTANT: To \'Save\' the game go \'Back\' to the Main Menu before quitting the App.Jet Set Willy for the ZX Spectrum (an 8-bit personal home computer released in the UK in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd, which sold in excess of 5 million units worldwide) is one of THE defining games of the 1980s.Jet Set Willy: ZX Spectrum is offered as an in-app purchase from within the Recreated ZX Spectrum app. The Recreated ZX Spectrum app includes more ZX Spectrum games plus Sinclair BASIC.Jet Set Willy: ZX Spectrum is also available in this stand-alone form. It does not include any other ZX Spectrum games but it does include an infinite-lives version.Jet Set Willy: ZX Spectrum is the 100% original ZX Spectrum game, written in 1984 and is brought to you - as an officially licenced product - utilizing our ZX Spectrum: Elite Collection technology.Featuring:- portrait and landscape play / display modes- iDaptive (user-definable, game-specific joystick, keypad & canvas) Controls- ‘auto save’, on exiting the game- authentic \'Spectrum\' soundJet Set Willy was published in 1984 by Software Projects. The game is a sequel to Manic Miner (1983), and is the second game in the immensely popular Miner Willy Series. The Plot: A tired Miner Willy  has to tidy up all the items left around his house after a huge party. With this done his housekeeper Maria will allow him access to his bedroom. Willy\'s mansion was bought with the wealth obtained from his adventures in Manic Miner  but much of it remains unexplored and it appears to be full of strange creatures, possibly a result of the previous (missing) owner\'s experiments. Willy must explore the enormous mansion and its grounds (including a beach and a yacht) to fully tidy up the house so he can get some much-needed sleep. Game-play: Willy moves from room to room in his mansion collecting objects. Unlike the screen-by-screen style of its prequel, the player can explore the mansion at will and tackle the screens in the order of their choosing. Willy is controlled using only left, right and jump. He can climb stairs by walking into them (jumping through them to avoid them) and climb swinging ropes by pushing left or right depending on what direction the rope is swinging in. The play area itself consists of 60 flick-screen  making-up the mansion and its grounds and containing hazards (static killer objects), patrolling monsters (killer guardians which move along predetermined paths), various platforms and collectable objects. The collectable items glow to distinguish them from other items in the room. Willy loses a life if he touches an enemy or falls too far, and he is returned to the point at which he entered the room. This may lead to a game-ending situation in which Willy repeatedly falls from a height, losing all lives in succession. Bugs: As originally released, the game could not be completed due to several bugs. Although actually four completely unrelated issues, they became known collectively as "The Attic Bug". After the player entered the room The Attic, various rooms would undergo corruption on all subsequent game plays, including all monsters disappearing from The Chapel, and other screens triggering instant death. Initially Software Projects attempted to pass off this bug off as an intentional feature to make the game more difficult, claiming that the rooms in question were filled with poison gas. However, they later rescinded this claim and issued a set of POKEs to correct the flaws.About Elite®: Elite Systems Ltd was incorporated in England in 1984.', '0')

The more you win, the more you earn.Spin wheel for daily rewardsPlay & beat your Facebook friendsSend gifts to your Facebook friendsRules of LudoThe players take turns to roll the dice. A player will have to roll a 6 before he or she is able to navigate a colored piece from its starting point to the starting square. After that, in each of the subsequent turns the player navigates a piece forward for one to six squares as indicated by the dice roll.When a 6 is rolled, the player may choose to advance a token already in play, or may enter another staged token to its starting square. Rolling a 6 earns the player an additional or "bonus" roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a 6 again, the player earns an additional bonus roll. If the third roll is also a 6, the player has to forfeit his/her turn which then passes to the next player. In cases where the player has rolled a six, the player may also choose to separate the chances if both pieces are active. For example, he or she can navigate one piece by 6 houses and another piece by 4 houses. Conversely, both the chances can be played using one single piece only; i.e. the player may navigate one piece for 6+4=10 houses.Players may not end their move on a square they already occupy. If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent\'s token, the opponent token is returned to its owner\'s yard. The returned token can be re-entered into play only when the owner rolls a 6. A player\'s home column squares are always safe.When a piece has navigated the board, it proceeds up the home column. A piece can only be moved onto the home pocket by an exact roll. The first player to move all 4 pieces into the home pocket wins.Get ready for the crazy adventure Ludo All Star is going to take you to, with it’s best ever in-game features.Download Ludo All Star now!

The term may also refer to a Vietnamese card game, Thirteen (card game). Chinese Poker also is known as "Thirteen cards" is a card game based on poker hand rankings. In Chinese Poker, each player receives a 13-card hand from a standard 52-card deck. Each player then has to divide their cards into three poker hands (known as "setting"): two containing five cards each (known as "the middle" and "the back"), and one containing three cards ("the front"); the back must be the highest-ranking hand, and the front, the lowest-ranking hand (note that straights and flushes do not count in the three-card hand). The backhand is placed face down on the table in front of the player, then the middle hand is placed face down in front of the backhand, and the front hand is placed face down in front of the middle hand. After all the players have set their hands, each player will announce in turn (clockwise, starting from the left of the dealer) whether or not they are playing their hand. All players then announce their royalties, before revealing their hands.If a player makes three flushes or three straights they automatically win the hand, regardless of the other players\' hands. As shown in the photo, the middle player has made all three hands flush and is an automatic winner.The rules are simple—only a basic knowledge of poker hand rankings is needed to get started. There is a large element of luck involved, therefore a beginner has a good chance of winning in the short term, even against experienced opponents. The game format results in frequent unexpected wins and high-ranking hands.', '3+')

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called "the Turtle". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans.As any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package.A tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.Don\'t forget to check our Game section for other fun games...', '0')

Most modern chess engines are so tactically strong that extremely careful defensive and anti-computer play is required to make any progress; in other words, it\'s nothing like playing a human. We wanted to create an engine that allows for a more human, strategic style of play where there\'s room to take advantage of the occasional blunder.We\'ve included a mate puzzle generator to create an almost infinite variety of checkmate puzzles that allow you to sharpen your chess instincts, and multiplayer modes that allow you to use your device as a virtual chessboard, or play via bluetooth or wireless with a local opponent.We\'ve also added a "Time Control" mode, to allow you to play using standard chess time controls, rather than a predefined difficulty level.Features include:- Mate puzzle generator - an almost infinite number of puzzles.- Two player mode over Bluetooth / Lan.- Tabletop mode so you can use your device as a virtual chessboard.- Various different boards, pieces and graphical options.- Support for all skill levels from total novice to expert.- Supports all orientations, so you can make full use of your iPad Smart Case or stand.- Supports multitasking, so you can follow along with videos/ebooks.- Focus mode, to hide the UI so you can focus on the board.- Puzzles and practice levels, so you can practice your endgames or play some interesting challenge levels.- Mini-tournament mode - a six-game mini tournament mode for the more serious player.- Elo rating estimation from your game results.', '0')

If you enjoy Risk, Carcassonne, Go, Stratego, or even Uno or Solitaire, you will love the “easy-to-learn, hard-to-master” fun of this game. @ 148 Apps: “It’s addicting, a pleasure to play, and has earned a permanent spot on my device.”@ App Advice: “It is heavy on strategy, but light on rules... you will be guaranteed endless amounts of fun.” @ Pocket Tactics: “Totems manages to challenge some of the basic assumptions of strategy gaming with it’s all-or-nothing take on territory control, while still being simple enough to learn in an afternoon. For that alone, it deserves to plant its standard on your iDevice’s shores.”  Score: 5 of 5! @ App Store: Featured by Apple in "Best New Games!"GAME DESCRIPTIONThe game design is derived from the world-famous “4-Color Map Theorem”. The randomness of the totems in your ‘hand’, the changing colors of the territories, the variety of the maps, and the cleverness of your opponents will all conspire to make each turn a fun and interesting challenge. The object of the game is to place carved animal pieces (totems) on the map in order to claim territories. Each turn you will place matching totems on adjacent territories to expand your control of the map. The player who conquers the most territories when the map is full, wins. A game of Totems can be finished super-quickly or slowly, depending on your skills and your approach. GAME FEATURES ===> Offline and Online Game Modes Match wits against computer-controlled characters. Take on your friends in Multi-player mode over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Or compete with random internet players, any time of day. ===> Opposing General A.I. Battle 5 generals: Scout, Warrior, Shaman, War Chief, and more. Each with different personalities and skills that range from easy to hard. You’ll need to keep your wits sharp to beat them all! ===> Build Your Rep Take your picture and easily create a custom icon with your face on it! Every player is given an ELO rating like in chess, that tells opponents your relative level of skill and experience. ===> Maps Maps come in all shapes and sizes with varying numbers of territories and difficulty level. Update your app for new releases. ===> HD Graphics and Sound. It\'s more than just a board game when you hear the whistle of the wind, the cry of a wolf, and watch the clouds glide across the map. The "Spaghetti Western" musical track completes the engrossing experience!===> IMPORTANTFor online games you must register in Game Center', '3+')

For example, what\'s the value of:16% * 20%We’ve added a “Math” help button to show you how to calculate this in your head. One way is, 20% means one-fifth. One-fifth of 16% is (16% / 5), which is a little more than 3%. 3.2% to be exact. Or, convert to decimals, multiply, then convert back to %age\'s.(2)This app uses specific hand situations, and some people don’t see the value in this because in real life play we don’t know our opponents’ cards. There’s still value in specific hand situations, because they’re the building blocks that we can use to put together and estimate the odds for more complex hand range situations. For example every good player should know the odds for specific hand situations like AJ vs. QQ pre-flop, or FlushDraw vs. TopPair on the flop. Our other apps e.g. PokerCruncher handle both specific hands and hand ranges.**********"... helps players learn some of the math behind poker ... teaches a general method of estimating odds for different Texas Hold\'em situations."  -- PokerSoftware.comMany more great reviews from poker experts, pros, and coaches, and on our TwoPlusTwo forum thread.(See our website.)*****Poker trainers, odds tables, etc. are useful tools but do they help you learn why the odds are what they are or are you just memorizing specific situations? And you can\'t use these tools or odds calculators in the middle of a live hand (would you really want to?; could be a “fish” tell :)). This app takes a new and different approach to poker odds - understanding instead of memorizing, so you can handle any situation that comes your way.Our odds estimation method is a pretty simple 3-step procedure. First you count your outs and estimate your odds of improving (using for example the "Rule of 4&2"; this app shows you how). Then you consider your opponent\'s counter-outs. Then you put the two together to come up with a good odds estimate.We\'ve provided about 20 common and important pre-flop and post-flop scenarios for you to practice the method on. This app will take you through the 3 steps for each practice scenario, one screen per step, and will make sure that you\'re on track towards a good odds estimate each step of the way, correcting you if needed. We\'ve provided info/help buttons for each sub-step.You might be thinking, how can you cover a game as complex as Texas Hold\'em in 20 scenarios? Well, we agree, you can\'t! But this app is about learning a general method not many specific situations, and we picked these 20 scenarios to cover a good cross-section of common and important pre-flop and post-flop situations. If you understand how to calculate the odds for say one generic TopPair vs TopPairTopKicker scenario or one representative Pair vs LowerPair pre-flop scenario, you\'ll be able to apply your knowledge to other similar situations easily.Now, we\'re not saying that you\'re going to master this in 5 or 10 minutes. You\'re going to have to practice the method more than a few times, think about the outs and counter-outs, and do simple math operations in your head - basic +, -, *, /; let\'s not let our math teachers down :). We hope you feel that acquiring this odds skill and knowledge is more than worth the learning/practice time.*****See our website for our strong free app update history over many years.Follow us on Facebook and Twitter.*****App Store reviews are greatly appreciated, thank you.*****Also please check out our companion apps Hold’em Odds Quizzer and PokerCruncher.*****', '0')

The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW) says "So, what\'s better about Set Pro HD than either the earlier Set app or a deck of Set cards. Well, pretty much everything.....". See http://www.tuaw.com/2010/08/13/app-review-set-pro-hd/. The SET game has won over 35 Best Game Awards. SET Pro HD enables you to find SETs at the speed of your brain. Using two hands you have the same speed advantage as you do in typing or playing the piano. The sense of a really fast player is, in fact, that of a piano player (see the YouTube demo - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eo_kY__glY – boy does this guy have good brain connections!). The SET game is also enjoyed when played with others. In multi-player game play there are no turns in the game. Up to four people can simultaneously play all using both hands. SET Pro HD removes all previous electronic limitations in all of its play modes, making this realization of the SET game a joy to play.To find a SET you must recognize three cards on the gameboard of 12 cards in which each of the features, examined independently, are either the same on the 3 cards OR different on the 3 cards. That’s it. One rule. It is deceptively simple. Thus, it’s easy to learn. A 6 year old can do it. But it’s a challenge for life, and mastering it challenges college students and their professors. The game has two levels Basic and Advanced. All players, regardless of age need to learn using the Basic level. Once you get the idea down, move to the Advanced level where you will experience the depth and richness of the mental challenge of SET. The Advanced level is the complete SET game. Of course, since SET is a game for all ages, younger players may take longer to be able to play the full game.  Basic level has 3 features that anyone can master. Advanced level has four features, which is a challenge for all.When you want a challenge for just yourself, SET Pro HD includes 6 solitaire game modes, Classical SET, Rediscovery SET, Sprint SET, Marathon SET, Puzzle SET, and Arcade SET. In Classical SET play, SET Pro HD challenges you to get through the deck in the shortest time finding SETs. In Rediscovery SET you try to get 25 SETs in the shortest time, with the cards either being rearranged, or, with 3 cards randomly replaced every 10 seconds if you don’t find a SET. In Sprint SET you are challenged to get the most SETs in 60 or 90 seconds. You never run out of cards. In Marathon SET you must pace yourself to get the best scores. Puzzle SET challenges you to find 4 or 6 SETs in a fixed gameboard of cards. Arcade SET paces you as you play requiring you to find SETs faster and faster until you cry ‘uncle’. In all game modes you can play either Basic or Advanced Level.In multiplayer mode, players tap their scorecards to take control of the board, and then tap-in their SET, or, after tapping they can swipe their scorecard (or tap the NO-SET icon) to gain additional points if they perceive that a NO-SET situation exists. A point is lost if 3 cards are selected that don’t make a SET, or if a player doesn’t tap the cards within the time limit.For beginners, there is an interactive Tutorial, and Hints are provided in all the game modes. Players can choose to play in teams. Your scores can be kept in the STATS if you choose, and in STATS ALL your best scores and those of all your friends are ranked if players want to see their rankings.Additional help and Tutorials are provided on the website http://www.setgame.com', '0')

On every match, all players receive the same stack with cards in the same order and thus the intellect of the player is the only variable to determine who gets the win.While Poker is played in innumerable forms, a player who understands the values of the Poker hands and the principles of betting can play without difficulty in any type of Poker game. Except in a few versions of the game, a Poker hand consists of five cards. The various combinations of Poker hands rank from five of a kind (the highest) to no pair or nothing (the lowest):Five of a Kind – This is the highest possible hand and can occur only in games where at least one card is wild, such as a joker, the two one-eyed jacks, or the four deuces. Examples of five of a kind would be four 10s and a wild card or two queens and three wild cards.Straight Flush – This is the highest possible hand when only the standard pack is used, and there are no wild cards. A straight flush consists of five cards of the same suit in sequence, such as 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 of hearts. The highest-ranking straight flush is the A, K, Q, J, and 10 of one suit, and this combination has a special name: a royal flush or a royal straight flush. The odds on being dealt this hand are 1 in almost 650,000.Four of a Kind – This is the next highest hand, and it ranks just below a straight flush. An example is four aces or four 3s. It does not matter what the fifth, unmatched card is.Full House – This colorful hand is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three 8s and two 4s, or three aces and two 6s.Flush – Five cards, all of the same suit, but not all in sequence, is a flush. An example is Q, 10, 7, 6, and 2 of clubs.Straight – Five cards in sequence, but not all of the same suit is a straight.Three of a Kind – This combination contains three cards of the same rank, and the other two cards each of a different rank, such as three jacks, a seven, and a four.Two Pairs – This hand contains a pair of one rank and another pair of a different rank, plus any fifth card of a different rank, such as Q, Q, 7, 7, 4.One Pair – This frequent combination contains just one pair with the other three cards being of different rank. An example is 10, 10, K, 4, 3.No Pair – This very common hand contains "nothing." None of the five cards pair up, nor are all five cards of the same suit or consecutive in rank. When more than one player has no pair, the hands are rated by the highest card each hand contains, so that an ace-high hand beats a king-high hand, and so on.• Enjoy our different tournament modalities where you can access to much bigger rewards apart from economic prizes.- Head to Head.- Bracket Tournaments.- Live events.• Add any user as a friend and challenge him directly.

Texas 42 is a trick taking game similar to bridge or spades. Invented in the late 1880s, it has become a tradition across generations of players. The sole motivator for the development of this app has been to create an AI that doesn\'t make the users wish they spent their 2 dollars on a soda instead of frustrating computer play. Much work has been made into creating an AI that makes the same moves you would. Since you don\'t have the same play style as everyone else, you can set each computer player to have one of 3 specified play styles "Conservative", "Normal", or "Aggressive". You can mix and match these styles as you see fit and can change them at any time in the game. A conservative player will tend to bid lower than the rest of the players. Its main focus when it has the lead is to draw all the trumps in play before moving on to non-trumps. If the conservative player does not have the highest trump, it will tend to lead with a junk/punt tile to draw out the higher ones, while holding on to tiles with count until it knows it can win with them. A normal player will tend to bid higher than a conservative player. Its main focus is holding on to its trumps for cases where count is on the table. If it does not have the highest trump it will tend to attempt to punt to its teammate. An aggressive player is a mixture of the two. It tends to push the bid to 31 or 34-36 with weaker hands than the other two and is more willing to bid marks if it has a strong hand. It is also willing to lay down trumps with 5 counts in an effort to draw out the ones covering the 10 count. Its more willing to play count at risk of hoping its partner will win the trick. For bidding purposes, your partner will respond to your bid. If you bid 30, you are indicating to your partner that you have a helping hand and it will be much more likely to outbid an opponent win the bid. ----------------------------------------------------- Here\'s what some beta testers have had to say about the app: "The AI has been impressive for me so far, not a single play that I\'ve seen has been stupid yet and I\'ve probably played around 10 games. Very solid game for my experience" "I really like your idea of the different styles of play and I think you are pretty close to that reality." "To date it is the best one out there. I have never felt like I was playing true 42 on the other apps."', 3)

This is often called a clairvoyant ability, and can enhance your life in many surprising ways.The player is presented with four colored squares.  For each trial, one has been selected at random by the ESP Trainer.  Your task is to choose the correct square.  If you succeed, you will hear a chime, feel a vibration, and see a large color picture. Otherwise, the system lights up the correct square, and you proceed with the next trial.  The score indicator at the top counts the number of correct choices.  Words of encouragement appear as you achieve the scoring levels of 6, 8. 10, 12 or 14 hits.  After 24 trials you may begin a new game.The game offers multi-sensory feedback, reinforcement, and an opportunity to Pass, meeting all the requirements needed for learning this skill. ESP Trainer improves your ability to recognize your intuitive impressions, and it can bring you to a level of intuitive awareness beyond anything you\'ve experienced before.The purpose of the trainer is to allow you to become aware of what it feels like when you psychically choose the correct square.  When you don\'t have that special feeling, we encourage you to press the Pass button.  (So this is not a "forced choice" test.)In a year long NASA program with 145 subjects (under Contract 953653 NAS7-100) many were able to significantly improve their scores. Four of the subjects improved their scores at the hundred-to-one level or better. This approach has been used with surprising success on Wall Street. But of course, past results are no guarantee of future performance.Because you are learning a new skill, slower is better than faster. If you find yourself frequently scoring 12 or more, write to the developer at his web site www.espresearch.com.  This game can provide the first steps toward experiencing and developing the psychic abilities hidden within us all.software by Levity Novelty LLC', '0')

In locations where the dealer stands on a soft 17, or redoubling is allowed, Spanish Blackjack 21 may be a better bet than blackjack, depending on the specific blackjack rules. If you are looking for a change of pace from traditional blackjack but insist on a game with a low house edge, then you may find new excitement in Spanish Blackjack 21.Key feature: * Gorgeous HD graphics and slick, fast gameplay* Realistic sounds, and smooth animations* Fast and clean interface.* Offline playable: you dont need an internet connection to play this game, it run perfectly fine when offline* Constant playing: you don\'t need to wait for other player to play this game* Completely free: you don\'t need any money to play this game, the chips in the game are also free to get.Here are the full rules of the game.Spanish Blackjack 21 uses six or eight Spanish decks, each deck consisting of 48 cards — the regular 52 cards less the four tens. Any card counter can tell you that removing any 10-point card from the cards moves the odds in favor of the dealer. To make up for this, Spanish Blackjack 21 gives the player a host of bonuses and favorable rules. There are lots of Spanish Blackjack 21 games all over the country, so rules will vary somewhat from place to place, but the usual rules in the player\'s favor are:+ Late surrender allowed.+ Double after split allowed.+ Re-splitting aces allowed.+ A player 21 always wins.+ Player blackjack beats dealer blackjack.+ Player may double on any number of cards.+ Player may usually hit and double down after splitting aces.+ Player may surrender after doubling, known as "double down rescue." The player forfeits an amount equal to his original bet.+ A five-card 21 pays 3 to 2, a six-card 21 pays 2 to 1, a seven or more card 21 pays 3 to 1. Bonus not honored after doubling.+ A 6-7-8 or 7-7-7 of mixed suits pays 3 to 2, of the same suit pays 2 to 1, and of spades pays 3 to 1. These bonuses do not pay after doubling.+ Suited 7-7-7 when the dealer has a seven face up pays 1000 for bets of 5-24 and 5000 "Super Bonus" for bets of 25 or over. In addition, all other players receive a 50 "envy bonus."

It won\'t tell you your odds of hitting a straight, or how many outs you have. It merely tells you where your pre-flop hand ranks - and your % chance of having the best hand on the flop. Yes, that\'s right - the flop, not the River. Why does it only tell you this? Because this is all you really need to know from a poker calculator. Any other numbers will only distract or mislead you. The biggest mistake other poker calculators make is they rank your hand by calculating your odds all the way to the River. But pre-flop, when you need to make a decision based on knowing only two cards, what you really want to know is how well you\'ll do on the FLOP. After the flop, there will be less players & more bluffing, and you\'ll need to rely more on instinct than math.That\'s why this little app is quick and to the point. "Pocket Odds" will simply tell you how strong your hand is, pre-flop. And it only takes three or four taps from you!So you may be wondering why you even need this program. After all, there are only 169 different starting hands in Holdem! This is true, but they "sort" quite a bit differently depending on the situation. How many opponents do you have? Are you looking to hit the flop, or wait to make your hand on the river?The truth is, hands act differently in different situations. Did you know that 10-9 suited turns into the top hand on the flop 48% more often against 8 players than it does heads-up? It\'s true! Additionally, hand strength is a bit different when looking at the flop instead of the river. For example, 7-2 off-suit, which is generally considered the worst starting hand in poker, averages better on the flop than 2-3, no matter how many opponents you have. In fact when "Heads-up", there are 16 hands that are worse "floppers" than 7-2 off."Pocket Odds" will tell you all this, instantly. (And discreetly - there is even a "vibrate" button so you can pretend you are getting an incoming text message!)Oh, and it will even tell you your odds of winning at the River, just in case you miss the other poker calculators :-)', '0')

Featuring:- portrait and landscape play / display modes- iDaptive (user-definable, game-specific joystick, keypad & canvass) Controls- (Google: "Tiny URL 22qh8hl") for more info- ‘auto save’, on exiting the game- authentic \'Spectrum\' soundManic Miner is a platform game originally written for the ZX Spectrum and released by Bug-Byte in 1983 (later re-released by Software Projects). It is the first game in the Miner Willy series and among the pioneers of the platform game genre. The game itself was inspired by the Atari 800 game Miner 2049er. It has since been ported to numerous home computers and video game consoles. At the time, its stand-out features included in-game music and sound effects, excellent playability, and colourful graphics, which were well designed for the graphical limitations of the ZX Spectrum. On the Spectrum this was the first game with in-game music, the playing of which required constant CPU attention and was thought impossible. It was cleverly achieved by constantly alternating CPU time between the music and the game (which accounts for the music\'s stuttery rhythm). The in-game music is In the Hall of the Mountain King from Edvard Grieg\'s music to Henrik Ibsen\'s play Peer Gynt. The music that plays during the title screen is an arrangement of An der schönen blauen Donau (popularly known as The Blue Danube), a waltz by Johann Strauß.Manic Miner for the ZX Spectrum contains the following 20 rooms:1. Central Cavern2. The Cold Room3. The Menagerie4. Abandoned Uranium Workings5. Eugene\'s Lair6. Processing Plant7. The Vat8. Miner Willy meets the Kong Beast9. Wacky Amoebatrons10. The Endorian Forest11. Attack of the Mutant Telephones12. Return of the Alien Kong Beast13. Ore Refinery14. Skylab Landing Bay15. The Bank16. The Sixteenth Cavern17. The Warehouse18. Amoebatrons\' Revenge19. Solar Power Generator20. The Final BarrierIn each of the twenty caverns are several flashing objects, which the player must collect before Willy\'s oxygen supply runs out. Once the player has collected the objects in one cavern, they must then go to the now-flashing portal, which will take them to the next cavern. The player must avoid enemies (listed in the cassette inlay) as Poisonous Pansies, Spiders, Slime, and Manic Mining Robots, which move backwards and forwards along a predefined length at constant speeds. Willy can also be killed by falling too far, so players must time the precision of jumps and other movements to prevent such falls or collisions with the enemies. The game ends when the player has no lives left; extra lives are gained every 10000 points.About Elite®: Elite Systems Ltd was incorporated in England in 1984.', '0')

Her kingdom was as large as it was magnificent, where every inhabitant was at peace, be it a super powerful gnome or tiny little fairy with powers to turn any boring old day into an unforgettable celebration. As the princess grew up, her advisors managed the kingdom before she came of age and was allowed to take the throne. Everyone knew of the young heiress\' beauty and splendor, but unfortunately, Layna was uninterested in the lives of her future subjects. She spent her days in worry-free joy, blissfully unaware of the responsibility of her future position. Finally her special day arrived! Nowhere in the kingdom was a single girl more stunning and exuberant than the princess, and nobody could imagine something could ever go wrong... The coronation was held in the sun-soaked throne room, music filled the air, and gallantly dressed members of the court greeted their future queen with smiling faces. It was as if in a fairytale dream, pure joy sent the princess\' head spinning, and she could hardly wait till she finally felt the weight of the crown upon her head. Then suddenly, the music stopped... Someone was flying through the crowd to the center of the room. Moments later, frightened to her core, Layna sees a witch before her. She had no idea what was going on. She couldn\'t even move a finger, almost as if she were under a spell. The uninvited guest\'s voice broke the deafening silence: ""You, who calls themselves the rightful heir to the throne, are you truly prepared to rule the kingdom and answer for the fate of your simple subjects?! You live in a world of luxury, have never known greif, and at any moment hundreds of hypocritical smiles are ready at your beck and call to bring whatever you so desire on a silver platter... Well then, so it shall be that no spoiled brat shall ever rule us!"" The witch flicked her wrist and a bright light flooded every inch of the throne room. Layna shut her eyes tight, and the floor disappeared... When the princess opened her eyes, she found herself on a haystack surrounded by endless fields instead of royal walls. A young man and his grandfather came rushing out of the nearby house to help her, but neither recognized the young girl as the future queen. Once Layna realized the evil witch\'s curse clouded the minds of her people, she resolved to hunt her down and prove she deserved to rule the kingdom! Find out if the princess ever manages to break the evil curse, or if the memory of princess Layna is destined to be forever forgotten!

Click "...More" to learn why you should download this App today!*** Featured In New and Newsworthy! ***Do you love to read? With iBouquiniste you\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'ll quickly find what you\'re looking for in the Author\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? Whether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor!

And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!

Our app enables you to record, retain, and retrieve names and people whenever and wherever you are. It makes a person feel good to hear their own name, and they pay more attention.  Research shows that hearing our name activates our brain, even when in a noisy room.  Influential leaders will make it a point to use people\'s names, and even to mention personal details that they share in common. They do this intentionally because they know it matters.  We feel better when people remember us, and worse when they don\'t.  When you forget someone\'s name, they feel that they (and their business!) are not important to you.It is no exaggeration that business deals often fail because someone failed to remember the right name at the right time.  In the age of email and online relationships, being able to use someone\'s name in a face-to-face meeting can set you apart. We intuitively know this, and yet without conscious effort, name recall is an elusive skill.  To make matters worse, this skill worsens after middle-age unless we train ourselves to remember.Who\'s Who has an option for spaced repetition.  This is a cognitive phenomenon where people recall information better when studied a few times over a long period of time than when studied many times over a short period.  If crammed memories are not refreshed, they are likely to decay to nothing.  If you enable reminders on the name that you enter, you will be sent a simple notification with the new name at increasingly long intervals.  You can turn reminders off easily at any time.Personal details such as hobbies or children\'s names can assist in memory recall.  Our memories are more like stories than items in a spreadsheet, and associating interesting tidbits with the name will actually help in recalling it. It is also useful to record when and where you met, not only because that data could be useful, but also it helps fill in the story that aids in memory recall. Our app has several optional fields for entering extraneous details for those very important contacts.  All of these fields can be searched in case you are trying to remember the name of the lady from "Hawaii" or the man who was an avid "baseball" fan.Memory experts often use mnemonics, word play, and outright whimsical visualizations. Think "Joe from Jersey," "Suzy sales," or "Richard the rich guy."   You might picture Roseanne holding a bouquet of roses, or Nancy wearing fancy pants.  Shirley drinking a Shirley Temple. If you are so inclined, our app has a "hint" field to capture your creative associations. The hint is revealed on demand in the Quiz, so that you can practice active recall testing.  Research has shown that active recall testing is far more effective at building strong memories than passive study.Most importantly, you must decide to make remembering names a priority.  The primary reason we have a problem remembering names is that we\'re not focused on learning it.  We have a lot of information competing for our attention, much of it more immediately important than a name.  Once you make the decision consciously to remember names because you care about the people you are interacting with, you immediately become much better at it.  Remember, people feel good when you remember their name, and worse when you don\'t.', '0')

Stick Pick suggests question starters for learners at different levels and also records how well students respond during classroom discussions. If a student is consistently scoring near the top or bottom, simply change the level so students aren\'t bored or frustrated. Depending on students\' levels of English proficiency, they might be asked simple yes-or-no questions or to elaborate in longer sentences.-----------------------------------------------DIFFERENTIATE INSTRUCTION-----------------------------------------------Stick Pick is the first app of its kind to uniquely link question stems to the cognitive or linguistic needs of each individual learner. Teachers can have multiple soup cans (classes) filled with sticks (students). During setup, teachers choose a category of question stems they wish to focus on for each learner. Questions can be based on Bloom\'s Taxonomy, English as a second language (ESL) skills, and degree of difficulty can be chosen for each learner. -----------------------------------------------TRACK FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT DATA-----------------------------------------------Formative assessment data is easy to track because teachers can tap a corresponding correct, incorrect, or opinion button based on the student\'s answer. Teachers can also rate each student\'s answer by selecting 0-5 on a critical thinking rubric (Bloom\'s) or an elaboration rubric (ESL). -----------------------------------------------EQUITY FOR ALL!-----------------------------------------------Stick Pick is a handy tool for any teacher device and can guide classroom discussion in really helpful ways. Teachers can mark sticks so they aren\'t constantly calling on the same students or asking students the same questions over and over again. Students in small groups can use Stick Pick, too. During small group work, students can take turns asking one another questions based on Bloom\'s Taxonomy, making group work more productive and on-task. -----------------------------------------------IMPROVE PARENT-SCHOOL COMMUNICATION-----------------------------------------------Student progress is recorded and averaged automatically within the app and can be shared in lots of convenient ways.-----------------------------------------------MANY SMART FEATURES-----------------------------------------------Finally -- no more sticks cluttering your desk! Now you can keep all your students’ sticks in one convenient place: on your mobile device!• Create as many classes as you need• Over 140 question stems categorized into three modes: Bloom’s; Bloom’s Revised; and ESL (English as a Second Language)• Copy an entire class, with or without scores• “Swipe up,” “tap,” or “shake” to call on a student• Level-appropriate question stems appear right on the screen• Option to operate in Stick Only mode• Sticks can be reset (put back in with the rest) or marked “used” in a special “used can”• Toggle between used and unused sticks with a single tap• Option to “peek” into each can to deliberately pick a particular student • Operates in Left or Right Hand mode• Collect formative assessment data using “Correct,” “Incorrect,” and “Opinion” buttons• Rate each learner\'s response on a 0-5 point rubric: use the Critical Thinking Rubric (for Bloom’s & Bloom’s Revised mode); or Degree of Elaboration Rubric (for ESL mode)• Share student data', '0')

"It\'s ok to write yet another graphing app, so long as it is the best one. And this is" -- Review by RightyC1 It features a simple, yet intuitive interface that makes it easy to enter and/or edit equations and visualize them in mathematical notation. It\'s also capable of displaying explicit and implicit equations as well as inequalities in both 2D and 3D, in all standard coordinate systems: cartesian, polar, spherical and cylindrical, all with amazing speed and beautiful results, which can be copied, emailed or saved to the photo library. It also includes an evaluate feature, in order to evaluate equations at specific points, as well as a library where you can store commonly used equations. Quick Graph+ differs from the free Quick Graph in that it already includes the advanced feature set which gives you access to all the features, such as implicit graphs and tracing. Keep in mind that for explicit graphs, you need to specify the dependent variable, since just typing "x^2" without the y=, will assume the expression to be "x^2=0" and it will be displayed as an implicit graph. Features: - Unlimited graphs.- VGA Output.- 2D - 3D equation plotting. - Library for commonly used equations. - Wireframe and solid visualization. - Support for cartesian, polar, cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems. - Pinch to zoom. - Drag to rotate - move. - Swipe to delete equations from the equation list. - Shake to reset view to original state, or to clear entry fields. - Double tap to change visualization modes. - Enhanced 2D mode for great hi-res graphics. - Adaptive 2D algorithms. - Enhanced 3D mode with better graphics. - In-app email so you can share graphics and equations. - Save to photo library. - Copy to clipboard. - Enhanced equation visualization. - Hyperbolic and Inverse functions. - Special functions such as Min, Max, if. - Interactive expression evaluation. - Implicit graphs and inequalities.- 2D tracing.- 2D independent axis scaling.- Labels and notes for library entries- Roots and Intersections- Value Table- Turn graphs on/off.We\'d love to hear your comments or suggestions, please drop us a line to info@kzlabs.me', '0')

This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.”--Common Sense Media “Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long?  Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.”--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u "First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, \'Leo loves First Words because it\'s fun and easy. I love it because he\'s learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.\'"---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious', '0')

Male and female robins look similar, though the males tend to be more brightly colored than their female counterparts.

Robin eggs are a unique blue color that has been named "robin\'s egg blue".Robins are often heard early in the morning, greeting the dawn with their song even before other birds begin to sing. These worm-eating birds might even be the inspiration behind the common saying, "the early bird gets the worm"!

Sorts existing records by the moon sign. Additional logic and information for cases with unknown birth time.What is the Moon Sign?Most people know their "star sign", but it\'s not the same. In fact, "star sign" is a misnamed Sun Sign, the sign of the Zodiac where the Sun was located at the moment of a person\'s birth. Sun Sign is an important astrological characteristic, and in most cases it can be easily figured out from one\'s date of birth. Most probably, you already know what is your Sign of the Zodiac. That\'s your Sun Sign.Now, here is a surprise for you: you also have a Moon Sign which is not less important than the Sun Sign, and in certain cases can be even more important. Typically, your Moon Sign is different from your Sun Sign, but for some people they can be the same. Astronomically, Moon Sign is the Sign of the Zodiac where the Moon was located at the moment of your birth.So why nobody knows their Moon Sign? That\'s because you can\'t easily figure it out from the date of birth, like you can do with the Sun Sign. It takes some complex astronomical calculations to find out one\'s Moon Sign.Fortunately, this app is more than happy to do for you all the complex calculations in a split of a second, just tell it the date and time of birth, as well as the location where the person was born. If the time of birth is unknown, the app will either tell you that the Moon Sign is certain anyway, as the Moon remained in the same sign on the date of birth, or it will inform you which two signs are possible candidates, and which part of the day belongs to each of them. You can then decide which of the signs is the most appropriate by reading their descriptions.The new version of the app offers a new user interface where all the records you’ve saved are sorted and grouped by the Moon Sign.', '0')

MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTORI’ve been a believer my whole life, I’ve attended Christian schools my whole life, and I’ve heard the stories of Jesus countless times. I’ve also seen every Jesus movie and miniseries ever made, and there have been dozens. So why a new TV show about Jesus?Because I have a passion for people to hear the “old, old story” again … for the very first time. When I see Jesus movies, it’s sometimes hard for me to feel moved or excited. I\'ve heard the stories before, and many Jesus projects just take you from Bible story to Bible story, not spending as much time on the humanity and backstories of all these characters. And they sometimes feel stiff and formal.So when we started to write a show that explores Jesus through the eyes of those around Him, we were repeatedly moved and excited. We explored the backstories of Simon Peter, Matthew, Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, and a few of Jesus’ miracle recipients, and in turn experienced Him in the way they did. We couldn’t help but identify with their recklessness, rough pasts, religious piety, and desperation for life change. And ultimately, their redemption.One of our favorite responses from an early screening? "The story of Jesus that actually appealed to my teenagers!"No matter where you’re at in your journey with Christ—whether you’re one of the many people in the gospels who encountered Jesus after a horrific past without Him, or you’re a Nicodemus who’s been a lifelong member of the God team—Jesus proved over and over that we have so much to learn and innumerable traits that need change.We hope this show allows you to see Jesus as they did. The end of the trailer tells you how to watch this show right now.', '3+')

This is your "swap".Step #3: move the camera to bring your "target" book cover into view and WizPix replaces it with the "swap" movie.Now instead of seeing the book cover you see yourself smiling and waving.Does WizPix Work On Anything?For the "target" image, any flat surface without any glare works just fine.Great examples are:  book cover, magazine cover, framed art work on the wall, a physical photo in your hand, poster on a wall, etc.Bad examples are: framed pictures behind glass, shiny objects with light glare, 3D objects like balls, vases, water bottles, etc.The "swap" image can be a movie from your camera, a photo from your camera, or a photo/movie from your Photos App.', '0')

To date, we have successfully helped our customers liquidate millions of dollars in prepaid cards and gift cards.DON’T LET YOUR PREPAID CARDS GO TO WASTEPrepaid cards and gift cards are restrictive and full of fees. Hidden monthly fees and online shopping restrictions significantly limit access to money on your prepaid cards. Physical prepaid cards and gift cards also lack any loss or theft protection. If you lose your card, you lose your money—it’s that simple. Consumers don’t realize that most prepaid card and gift card owners never end up redeeming the full balance of their card. Don’t fall into the fee trap—get cash for your prepaid cards and gift cards today! SPEND YOUR MONEY WHEN AND HOW YOU WANTPrepaid2Cash allows you to easily access your prepaid card and gift card funds. We deposit your funds directly into your bank account for prepaid cards, which allows you to pay your bills or save up for a much-needed vacation!LOWEST FEES IN THE MARKETPrepaid2Cash charges the lowest fees in the market and you can choose to receive your money in as little as 15 minutes or the next business day.YOUR SECURITY IS OUR PRIORITY Prepaid2Cash makes cashing out your prepaid cards and gift cards quick and easy, and we take the protection of your Prepaid2Cash account very seriously by using security measures to help protect your account information.HOW PREPAID2CASH WORKS1) Scan your card – using your phone’s camera or enter your prepaid card information manually.2) Pick a time – get your cash delivered in 15 minutes or the next business day.3) Pick a place – we offer direct deposit into your bank account and we support multiple accounts.CUSTOMER TESTIMONIALS"This company is very professional in how it conducts its business.

"I\'m glad I found P2C because it allowed me to finally get some value out my stack of unused prepaid cards that sat at home unused.""I needed the cash to pay for rent. Great and fast service with reasonable prices. I love this site and I would definitely recommend it to friends.""Prepaid cards can be a hassle to use. They often just end up in a drawer. This is a convenient way to use any prepaid cards that you have laying around."ABOUT PREPAID2CASHPrepaid2Cash was founded by two financial technology entrepreneurs and is based in Birmingham, AL. The founders frequently received rebate and award gift cards from buying goods online and could not find any way to redeem the cards for cash. After experiencing this consumer pain point first hand, they partnered with leading banking and payments institutions to offer a simple and fast service to help consumers redeem their unwanted prepaid cards. The company and service came to be known as Prepaid2Cash, which was officially launched to the public in early 2016.Prepaid2Cash is an agent of Evolve Bank & Trust.

The effects could be serious – you want the steak medium but it’s still dripping blood. Or your anticipated rare steak is overdone and tough as leather.But, it doesn’t have to be that way. The Steak Master is easy to use and will help you cook your steaks just as you like them every time.The perfect preparation of steaks with the Steak Master is simple:1. First, you determine the type of temperature scale on your oven’s temperature control knob by tapping on the configuration button. That is important, because the Steak Master needs this information in order to give you the correct oven temperature later on. You only have to do this once per oven.2. Decide if you want to use just a frying pan or both frying pan and oven (the professional way). Using only the frying pan is much quicker than the use of frying pan and oven. The meat never leaves the pan until it’s done, whereas the slightly longer expert’s way requires both frying pan and oven, but results in perfectly juicy steaks.  3. Most important: The thickness of the steak and how you would like to have your steak . The Steak Master helps you to define both. Just tap on the pictures or the controller under the pictures and select how well done you would like to have your steak. Then tap on „Thickness of steak“, hold the steak sideways next to your iPhone/iPod and measure its thickness with your index finger.4. Here we go! The Steak Master guides you step by step through the menu, tells you what you need and shows you what to do in chronological order. For example how much you have to heat up the butter/oil in your frying pan.5. When your butter/oil is slightly bubbling it’s time to sear the steak. The Steak Master counts down the time before you have to turn over the steak.6. After searing your meat you just follow the instructions the Steak Master is giving you. Did you choose the cooking with the frying pan, reduce the heat to the temperature the Steak Master states on the display and simply finish the cooking in the pan. How long you have to cook and how often you have to turn the meat – the Steak Master-App has got the answer! A small treat are the Steak-Spy and the Steak-O-Meter:  they show you the condition and the progress of the steak during the cooking phase until it‘s finished. Then take the meat out of the pan, wrap it up with tin foil and let it rest. How long? The Steak Master tells you automatically.7. If you decided to use a frying pan and the oven it’s the same method, only that you have to follow the additional instructions of the Steak-Master-App for the use of the oven. Either way you choose – the result is a perfectly cooked steak and a great meal. Enjoy!Highlights- The Steak-Master calculates from the thickness of the steak and the chosen steak result (e.g. rare or medium) exactly to the second the time the steak needs to cook.- The formula is based on hundreds of tests by experienced steak experts.- Fool-proof preparation: simply determine thickness of the steak, the way you would like to have the steak done and follow the illustrated instructions of the App step by step.- The Steak Spy shows you the inside of the steak during the cooking progress.', '0')

Other reader apps still don\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'ll quickly find what you\'re looking for in the Author\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

With iBouquiniste you\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'ll quickly find what you\'re looking for in the Author\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? Whether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! From Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! The app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!

Our app enables you to record, retain, and retrieve names and people whenever and wherever you are. It makes a person feel good to hear their own name, and they pay more attention.  Research shows that hearing our name activates our brain, even when in a noisy room.  Influential leaders will make it a point to use people\'s names, and even to mention personal details that they share in common. They do this intentionally because they know it matters.  We feel better when people remember us, and worse when they don\'t.  When you forget someone\'s name, they feel that they (and their business!) are not important to you.It is no exaggeration that business deals often fail because someone failed to remember the right name at the right time.  In the age of email and online relationships, being able to use someone\'s name in a face-to-face meeting can set you apart. We intuitively know this, and yet without conscious effort, name recall is an elusive skill.  To make matters worse, this skill worsens after middle-age unless we train ourselves to remember.Who\'s Who has an option for spaced repetition.  This is a cognitive phenomenon where people recall information better when studied a few times over a long period of time than when studied many times over a short period.  If crammed memories are not refreshed, they are likely to decay to nothing.  If you enable reminders on the name that you enter, you will be sent a simple notification with the new name at increasingly long intervals.  You can turn reminders off easily at any time.Personal details such as hobbies or children\'s names can assist in memory recall.  Our memories are more like stories than items in a spreadsheet, and associating interesting tidbits with the name will actually help in recalling it. It is also useful to record when and where you met, not only because that data could be useful, but also it helps fill in the story that aids in memory recall. Our app has several optional fields for entering extraneous details for those very important contacts.  All of these fields can be searched in case you are trying to remember the name of the lady from "Hawaii" or the man who was an avid "baseball" fan.Memory experts often use mnemonics, word play, and outright whimsical visualizations. Think "Joe from Jersey," "Suzy sales," or "Richard the rich guy."   You might picture Roseanne holding a bouquet of roses, or Nancy wearing fancy pants.  Shirley drinking a Shirley Temple. If you are so inclined, our app has a "hint" field to capture your creative associations. The hint is revealed on demand in the Quiz, so that you can practice active recall testing.  Research has shown that active recall testing is far more effective at building strong memories than passive study.Most importantly, you must decide to make remembering names a priority.  The primary reason we have a problem remembering names is that we\'re not focused on learning it.  We have a lot of information competing for our attention, much of it more immediately important than a name.  Once you make the decision consciously to remember names because you care about the people you are interacting with, you immediately become much better at it.  Remember, people feel good when you remember their name, and worse when you don\'t.', '0')

Stick Pick suggests question starters for learners at different levels and also records how well students respond during classroom discussions. If a student is consistently scoring near the top or bottom, simply change the level so students aren\'t bored or frustrated. Depending on students\' levels of English proficiency, they might be asked simple yes-or-no questions or to elaborate in longer sentences.-----------------------------------------------DIFFERENTIATE INSTRUCTION-----------------------------------------------Stick Pick is the first app of its kind to uniquely link question stems to the cognitive or linguistic needs of each individual learner. Teachers can have multiple soup cans (classes) filled with sticks (students). During setup, teachers choose a category of question stems they wish to focus on for each learner. Questions can be based on Bloom\'s Taxonomy, English as a second language (ESL) skills, and degree of difficulty can be chosen for each learner. -----------------------------------------------TRACK FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT DATA-----------------------------------------------Formative assessment data is easy to track because teachers can tap a corresponding correct, incorrect, or opinion button based on the student\'s answer. Teachers can also rate each student\'s answer by selecting 0-5 on a critical thinking rubric (Bloom\'s) or an elaboration rubric (ESL). -----------------------------------------------EQUITY FOR ALL!-----------------------------------------------Stick Pick is a handy tool for any teacher device and can guide classroom discussion in really helpful ways. Teachers can mark sticks so they aren\'t constantly calling on the same students or asking students the same questions over and over again. Students in small groups can use Stick Pick, too. During small group work, students can take turns asking one another questions based on Bloom\'s Taxonomy, making group work more productive and on-task. -----------------------------------------------IMPROVE PARENT-SCHOOL COMMUNICATION-----------------------------------------------Student progress is recorded and averaged automatically within the app and can be shared in lots of convenient ways.-----------------------------------------------MANY SMART FEATURES-----------------------------------------------Finally -- no more sticks cluttering your desk!

And this is" -- Review by RightyC1 It features a simple, yet intuitive interface that makes it easy to enter and/or edit equations and visualize them in mathematical notation. It\'s also capable of displaying explicit and implicit equations as well as inequalities in both 2D and 3D, in all standard coordinate systems: cartesian, polar, spherical and cylindrical, all with amazing speed and beautiful results, which can be copied, emailed or saved to the photo library. It also includes an evaluate feature, in order to evaluate equations at specific points, as well as a library where you can store commonly used equations. Quick Graph+ differs from the free Quick Graph in that it already includes the advanced feature set which gives you access to all the features, such as implicit graphs and tracing. Keep in mind that for explicit graphs, you need to specify the dependent variable, since just typing "x^2" without the y=, will assume the expression to be "x^2=0" and it will be displayed as an implicit graph. Features: - Unlimited graphs.- VGA Output.- 2D - 3D equation plotting. - Library for commonly used equations. - Wireframe and solid visualization. - Support for cartesian, polar, cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems. - Pinch to zoom. - Drag to rotate - move. - Swipe to delete equations from the equation list. - Shake to reset view to original state, or to clear entry fields. - Double tap to change visualization modes. - Enhanced 2D mode for great hi-res graphics. - Adaptive 2D algorithms. - Enhanced 3D mode with better graphics. - In-app email so you can share graphics and equations. - Save to photo library. - Copy to clipboard. - Enhanced equation visualization. - Hyperbolic and Inverse functions. - Special functions such as Min, Max, if. - Interactive expression evaluation. - Implicit graphs and inequalities.- 2D tracing.- 2D independent axis scaling.- Labels and notes for library entries- Roots and Intersections- Value Table- Turn graphs on/off.We\'d love to hear your comments or suggestions, please drop us a line to info@kzlabs.me', '0')

Male and female robins look similar, though the males tend to be more brightly colored than their female counterparts. While these birds do migrate south in the winter, they can typically be found throughout most of the United States year-round. Aside from their bright red chest, robins are also known for another color - the color of their eggs! Robin eggs are a unique blue color that has been named "robin\'s egg blue".Robins are often heard early in the morning, greeting the dawn with their song even before other birds begin to sing. These worm-eating birds might even be the inspiration behind the common saying, "the early bird gets the worm"! Robins sing a cheery whistling song comprised of roughly ten notes in repeated syllables. Robins also use various other calls to communicate, from soft cucks to alarmed peeps!

Sorts existing records by the moon sign. Additional logic and information for cases with unknown birth time.What is the Moon Sign?Most people know their "star sign", but it\'s not the same. In fact, "star sign" is a misnamed Sun Sign, the sign of the Zodiac where the Sun was located at the moment of a person\'s birth. Sun Sign is an important astrological characteristic, and in most cases it can be easily figured out from one\'s date of birth. Most probably, you already know what is your Sign of the Zodiac. That\'s your Sun Sign.Now, here is a surprise for you: you also have a Moon Sign which is not less important than the Sun Sign, and in certain cases can be even more important. Typically, your Moon Sign is different from your Sun Sign, but for some people they can be the same. Astronomically, Moon Sign is the Sign of the Zodiac where the Moon was located at the moment of your birth.So why nobody knows their Moon Sign? That\'s because you can\'t easily figure it out from the date of birth, like you can do with the Sun Sign. It takes some complex astronomical calculations to find out one\'s Moon Sign.Fortunately, this app is more than happy to do for you all the complex calculations in a split of a second, just tell it the date and time of birth, as well as the location where the person was born. If the time of birth is unknown, the app will either tell you that the Moon Sign is certain anyway, as the Moon remained in the same sign on the date of birth, or it will inform you which two signs are possible candidates, and which part of the day belongs to each of them. You can then decide which of the signs is the most appropriate by reading their descriptions.The new version of the app offers a new user interface where all the records you’ve saved are sorted and grouped by the Moon Sign.', '0')

MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTORI’ve been a believer my whole life, I’ve attended Christian schools my whole life, and I’ve heard the stories of Jesus countless times. I’ve also seen every Jesus movie and miniseries ever made, and there have been dozens. So why a new TV show about Jesus?Because I have a passion for people to hear the “old, old story” again … for the very first time. When I see Jesus movies, it’s sometimes hard for me to feel moved or excited. I\'ve heard the stories before, and many Jesus projects just take you from Bible story to Bible story, not spending as much time on the humanity and backstories of all these characters. And they sometimes feel stiff and formal.So when we started to write a show that explores Jesus through the eyes of those around Him, we were repeatedly moved and excited. We explored the backstories of Simon Peter, Matthew, Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, and a few of Jesus’ miracle recipients, and in turn experienced Him in the way they did. We couldn’t help but identify with their recklessness, rough pasts, religious piety, and desperation for life change. And ultimately, their redemption.One of our favorite responses from an early screening? "The story of Jesus that actually appealed to my teenagers!"No matter where you’re at in your journey with Christ—whether you’re one of the many people in the gospels who encountered Jesus after a horrific past without Him, or you’re a Nicodemus who’s been a lifelong member of the God team—Jesus proved over and over that we have so much to learn and innumerable traits that need change.We hope this show allows you to see Jesus as they did. The end of the trailer tells you how to watch this show right now.', '3+')

This is your "target".Step #2: use the camera to take a movie or picture of, for example, yourself smiling and waving. This is your "swap".Step #3: move the camera to bring your "target" book cover into view and WizPix replaces it with the "swap" movie.Now instead of seeing the book cover you see yourself smiling and waving.Does WizPix Work On Anything?For the "target" image, any flat surface without any glare works just fine.Great examples are:  book cover, magazine cover, framed art work on the wall, a physical photo in your hand, poster on a wall, etc.Bad examples are: framed pictures behind glass, shiny objects with light glare, 3D objects like balls, vases, water bottles, etc.The "swap" image can be a movie from your camera, a photo from your camera, or a photo/movie from your Photos App.', '0')

The effects could be serious – you want the steak medium but it’s still dripping blood. Or your anticipated rare steak is overdone and tough as leather.But, it doesn’t have to be that way. The Steak Master is easy to use and will help you cook your steaks just as you like them every time.The perfect preparation of steaks with the Steak Master is simple:1. First, you determine the type of temperature scale on your oven’s temperature control knob by tapping on the configuration button. That is important, because the Steak Master needs this information in order to give you the correct oven temperature later on. You only have to do this once per oven.2. Decide if you want to use just a frying pan or both frying pan and oven (the professional way). Using only the frying pan is much quicker than the use of frying pan and oven. The meat never leaves the pan until it’s done, whereas the slightly longer expert’s way requires both frying pan and oven, but results in perfectly juicy steaks.  3. Most important: The thickness of the steak and how you would like to have your steak . The Steak Master helps you to define both. Just tap on the pictures or the controller under the pictures and select how well done you would like to have your steak. Then tap on „Thickness of steak“, hold the steak sideways next to your iPhone/iPod and measure its thickness with your index finger.4. Here we go! The Steak Master guides you step by step through the menu, tells you what you need and shows you what to do in chronological order. For example how much you have to heat up the butter/oil in your frying pan.5. When your butter/oil is slightly bubbling it’s time to sear the steak. The Steak Master counts down the time before you have to turn over the steak.6. After searing your meat you just follow the instructions the Steak Master is giving you. Did you choose the cooking with the frying pan, reduce the heat to the temperature the Steak Master states on the display and simply finish the cooking in the pan. How long you have to cook and how often you have to turn the meat – the Steak Master-App has got the answer! A small treat are the Steak-Spy and the Steak-O-Meter:  they show you the condition and the progress of the steak during the cooking phase until it‘s finished. Then take the meat out of the pan, wrap it up with tin foil and let it rest. How long? The Steak Master tells you automatically.7. If you decided to use a frying pan and the oven it’s the same method, only that you have to follow the additional instructions of the Steak-Master-App for the use of the oven. Either way you choose – the result is a perfectly cooked steak and a great meal. Enjoy!Highlights- The Steak-Master calculates from the thickness of the steak and the chosen steak result (e.g. rare or medium) exactly to the second the time the steak needs to cook.- The formula is based on hundreds of tests by experienced steak experts.- Fool-proof preparation: simply determine thickness of the steak, the way you would like to have the steak done and follow the illustrated instructions of the App step by step.- The Steak Spy shows you the inside of the steak during the cooking progress.', '0')

Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?

Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? Whether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! From Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! The app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!

Our app enables you to record, retain, and retrieve names and people whenever and wherever you are. It makes a person feel good to hear their own name, and they pay more attention.  Research shows that hearing our name activates our brain, even when in a noisy room.  Influential leaders will make it a point to use people\'\'s names, and even to mention personal details that they share in common. They do this intentionally because they know it matters.  We feel better when people remember us, and worse when they don\'\'t.  When you forget someone\'\'s name, they feel that they (and their business!) are not important to you.It is no exaggeration that business deals often fail because someone failed to remember the right name at the right time.  In the age of email and online relationships, being able to use someone\'\'s name in a face-to-face meeting can set you apart. We intuitively know this, and yet without conscious effort, name recall is an elusive skill.  To make matters worse, this skill worsens after middle-age unless we train ourselves to remember.Who\'\'s Who has an option for spaced repetition.  This is a cognitive phenomenon where people recall information better when studied a few times over a long period of time than when studied many times over a short period.  If crammed memories are not refreshed, they are likely to decay to nothing.  If you enable reminders on the name that you enter, you will be sent a simple notification with the new name at increasingly long intervals.  You can turn reminders off easily at any time.Personal details such as hobbies or children\'\'s names can assist in memory recall.  Our memories are more like stories than items in a spreadsheet, and associating interesting tidbits with the name will actually help in recalling it. It is also useful to record when and where you met, not only because that data could be useful, but also it helps fill in the story that aids in memory recall. Our app has several optional fields for entering extraneous details for those very important contacts.  All of these fields can be searched in case you are trying to remember the name of the lady from "Hawaii" or the man who was an avid "baseball" fan.Memory experts often use mnemonics, word play, and outright whimsical visualizations. Think "Joe from Jersey," "Suzy sales," or "Richard the rich guy."   You might picture Roseanne holding a bouquet of roses, or Nancy wearing fancy pants.  Shirley drinking a Shirley Temple. If you are so inclined, our app has a "hint" field to capture your creative associations. The hint is revealed on demand in the Quiz, so that you can practice active recall testing.  Research has shown that active recall testing is far more effective at building strong memories than passive study.Most importantly, you must decide to make remembering names a priority.  The primary reason we have a problem remembering names is that we\'\'re not focused on learning it.  We have a lot of information competing for our attention, much of it more immediately important than a name.  Once you make the decision consciously to remember names because you care about the people you are interacting with, you immediately become much better at it.  Remember, people feel good when you remember their name, and worse when you don\'\'t.', '0')

Stick Pick suggests question starters for learners at different levels and also records how well students respond during classroom discussions. If a student is consistently scoring near the top or bottom, simply change the level so students aren\'\'t bored or frustrated. Depending on students\'\' levels of English proficiency, they might be asked simple yes-or-no questions or to elaborate in longer sentences.-----------------------------------------------DIFFERENTIATE INSTRUCTION-----------------------------------------------Stick Pick is the first app of its kind to uniquely link question stems to the cognitive or linguistic needs of each individual learner. Teachers can have multiple soup cans (classes) filled with sticks (students). During setup, teachers choose a category of question stems they wish to focus on for each learner. Questions can be based on Bloom\'\'s Taxonomy, English as a second language (ESL) skills, and degree of difficulty can be chosen for each learner. -----------------------------------------------TRACK FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT DATA-----------------------------------------------Formative assessment data is easy to track because teachers can tap a corresponding correct, incorrect, or opinion button based on the student\'\'s answer. Teachers can also rate each student\'\'s answer by selecting 0-5 on a critical thinking rubric (Bloom\'\'s) or an elaboration rubric (ESL). -----------------------------------------------EQUITY FOR ALL!-----------------------------------------------Stick Pick is a handy tool for any teacher device and can guide classroom discussion in really helpful ways. Teachers can mark sticks so they aren\'\'t constantly calling on the same students or asking students the same questions over and over again. Students in small groups can use Stick Pick, too. During small group work, students can take turns asking one another questions based on Bloom\'\'s Taxonomy, making group work more productive and on-task. -----------------------------------------------IMPROVE PARENT-SCHOOL COMMUNICATION-----------------------------------------------Student progress is recorded and averaged automatically within the app and can be shared in lots of convenient ways.-----------------------------------------------MANY SMART FEATURES-----------------------------------------------Finally -- no more sticks cluttering your desk!

It\'\'s also capable of displaying explicit and implicit equations as well as inequalities in both 2D and 3D, in all standard coordinate systems: cartesian, polar, spherical and cylindrical, all with amazing speed and beautiful results, which can be copied, emailed or saved to the photo library. It also includes an evaluate feature, in order to evaluate equations at specific points, as well as a library where you can store commonly used equations. Quick Graph+ differs from the free Quick Graph in that it already includes the advanced feature set which gives you access to all the features, such as implicit graphs and tracing. Keep in mind that for explicit graphs, you need to specify the dependent variable, since just typing "x^2" without the y=, will assume the expression to be "x^2=0" and it will be displayed as an implicit graph.

Robins usually have black or brown heads and backs, but boast a bright red to orange chest that makes them easy to spot! Male and female robins look similar, though the males tend to be more brightly colored than their female counterparts. While these birds do migrate south in the winter, they can typically be found throughout most of the United States year-round. Aside from their bright red chest, robins are also known for another color - the color of their eggs! Robin eggs are a unique blue color that has been named "robin\'\'s egg blue".Robins are often heard early in the morning, greeting the dawn with their song even before other birds begin to sing. These worm-eating birds might even be the inspiration behind the common saying, "the early bird gets the worm"! Robins sing a cheery whistling song comprised of roughly ten notes in repeated syllables. Robins also use various other calls to communicate, from soft cucks to alarmed peeps!

In fact, "star sign" is a misnamed Sun Sign, the sign of the Zodiac where the Sun was located at the moment of a person\'\'s birth. Sun Sign is an important astrological characteristic, and in most cases it can be easily figured out from one\'\'s date of birth. Most probably, you already know what is your Sign of the Zodiac. That\'\'s your Sun Sign.Now, here is a surprise for you: you also have a Moon Sign which is not less important than the Sun Sign, and in certain cases can be even more important. Typically, your Moon Sign is different from your Sun Sign, but for some people they can be the same. Astronomically, Moon Sign is the Sign of the Zodiac where the Moon was located at the moment of your birth.So why nobody knows their Moon Sign? That\'\'s because you can\'\'t easily figure it out from the date of birth, like you can do with the Sun Sign. It takes some complex astronomical calculations to find out one\'\'s Moon Sign.Fortunately, this app is more than happy to do for you all the complex calculations in a split of a second, just tell it the date and time of birth, as well as the location where the person was born. If the time of birth is unknown, the app will either tell you that the Moon Sign is certain anyway, as the Moon remained in the same sign on the date of birth, or it will inform you which two signs are possible candidates, and which part of the day belongs to each of them. You can then decide which of the signs is the most appropriate by reading their descriptions.The new version of the app offers a new user interface where all the records you’ve saved are sorted and grouped by the Moon Sign.', '0')

Click "...More" to learn why you should download this App today!*** Featured In New and Newsworthy! ***Do you love to read? With iBouquiniste you\'\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don\'\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'\'ll quickly find what you\'\'re looking for in the Author\'\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

Click "...More" to learn why you should download this App today!*** Featured In New and Newsworthy! ***Do you love to read? With iBouquiniste you\'\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don\'\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'\'ll quickly find what you\'\'re looking for in the Author\'\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

Other reader apps still don\'\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'\'ll quickly find what you\'\'re looking for in the Author\'\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

Other reader apps still don\'\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'\'ll quickly find what you\'\'re looking for in the Author\'\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? Whether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! From Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! The app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!

Our app enables you to record, retain, and retrieve names and people whenever and wherever you are. It makes a person feel good to hear their own name, and they pay more attention.  Research shows that hearing our name activates our brain, even when in a noisy room.  Influential leaders will make it a point to use people\'\'s names, and even to mention personal details that they share in common. They do this intentionally because they know it matters.  We feel better when people remember us, and worse when they don\'\'t.  When you forget someone\'\'s name, they feel that they (and their business!) are not important to you.It is no exaggeration that business deals often fail because someone failed to remember the right name at the right time.  In the age of email and online relationships, being able to use someone\'\'s name in a face-to-face meeting can set you apart. We intuitively know this, and yet without conscious effort, name recall is an elusive skill.  To make matters worse, this skill worsens after middle-age unless we train ourselves to remember.Who\'\'s Who has an option for spaced repetition.  This is a cognitive phenomenon where people recall information better when studied a few times over a long period of time than when studied many times over a short period.  If crammed memories are not refreshed, they are likely to decay to nothing.  If you enable reminders on the name that you enter, you will be sent a simple notification with the new name at increasingly long intervals.  You can turn reminders off easily at any time.Personal details such as hobbies or children\'\'s names can assist in memory recall.  Our memories are more like stories than items in a spreadsheet, and associating interesting tidbits with the name will actually help in recalling it. It is also useful to record when and where you met, not only because that data could be useful, but also it helps fill in the story that aids in memory recall. Our app has several optional fields for entering extraneous details for those very important contacts.  All of these fields can be searched in case you are trying to remember the name of the lady from "Hawaii" or the man who was an avid "baseball" fan.Memory experts often use mnemonics, word play, and outright whimsical visualizations. Think "Joe from Jersey," "Suzy sales," or "Richard the rich guy."   You might picture Roseanne holding a bouquet of roses, or Nancy wearing fancy pants.  Shirley drinking a Shirley Temple. If you are so inclined, our app has a "hint" field to capture your creative associations. The hint is revealed on demand in the Quiz, so that you can practice active recall testing.  Research has shown that active recall testing is far more effective at building strong memories than passive study.Most importantly, you must decide to make remembering names a priority.  The primary reason we have a problem remembering names is that we\'\'re not focused on learning it.  We have a lot of information competing for our attention, much of it more immediately important than a name.  Once you make the decision consciously to remember names because you care about the people you are interacting with, you immediately become much better at it.  Remember, people feel good when you remember their name, and worse when you don\'\'t.', '0')

With iBouquiniste you\'\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don\'\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'\'ll quickly find what you\'\'re looking for in the Author\'\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading. Download iBouquiniste now and have all of your books at your fingertips.', '3+')

Whether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor!

Click "...More" to learn why you should download this App today!*** Featured In New and Newsworthy! ***Do you love to read? With iBouquiniste you\'\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don\'\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'\'ll quickly find what you\'\'re looking for in the Author\'\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

Click "...More" to learn why you should download this App today!*** Featured In New and Newsworthy! ***Do you love to read? With iBouquiniste you\'\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use.

Other reader apps still don\'\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'\'ll quickly find what you\'\'re looking for in the Author\'\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

Click "...More" to learn why you should download this App today!*** Featured In New and Newsworthy! ***Do you love to read? With iBouquiniste you\'\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don\'\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'\'ll quickly find what you\'\'re looking for in the Author\'\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

This app supports FB2, EPUB, MOBI, PDF, DJVU, CBR, CBZ and TXT formats and offers adjustable fonts, paragraph indents, paper type and more. iBouquiniste gives you a reading experience that\'s as close as you can get to reading a real book, and it even lets you share your favorite books via email. Click "...More" to learn why you should download this App today!*** Featured In New and Newsworthy! ***Do you love to read? With iBouquiniste you\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'ll quickly find what you\'re looking for in the Author\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

This app supports FB2, EPUB, MOBI, PDF, DJVU, CBR, CBZ and TXT formats and offers adjustable fonts, paragraph indents, paper type and more. iBouquiniste gives you a reading experience that\'s as close as you can get to reading a real book, and it even lets you share your favorite books via email. Click "...More" to learn why you should download this App today!*** Featured In New and Newsworthy! ***Do you love to read? With iBouquiniste you\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'ll quickly find what you\'re looking for in the Author\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

This app supports FB2, EPUB, MOBI, PDF, DJVU, CBR, CBZ and TXT formats and offers adjustable fonts, paragraph indents, paper type and more. iBouquiniste gives you a reading experience that\'s as close as you can get to reading a real book, and it even lets you share your favorite books via email. Click "...More" to learn why you should download this App today!*** Featured In New and Newsworthy! ***Do you love to read? With iBouquiniste you\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'ll quickly find what you\'re looking for in the Author\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

That\'\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'\'ll quickly find what you\'\'re looking for in the Author\'\'s Library.

Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?

Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? Whether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! From Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! The app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!

Other reader apps still don\'\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'\'ll quickly find what you\'\'re looking for in the Author\'\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? Whether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! From Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! The app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!

With iBouquiniste you\'\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don\'\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'\'ll quickly find what you\'\'re looking for in the Author\'\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

From Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! The app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!

Your child has many different treatments and medicines to choose from to cure the animals and make them happy again. 3. Every time your child plays the App the animals have different illnesses, injuries and diseases.                                                                                             4.

This app supports FB2, EPUB, MOBI, PDF, DJVU, CBR, CBZ and TXT formats and offers adjustable fonts, paragraph indents, paper type and more. iBouquiniste gives you a reading experience that\'\'s as close as you can get to reading a real book, and it even lets you share your favorite books via email. Click "...More" to learn why you should download this App today!*** Featured In New and Newsworthy! ***Do you love to read? With iBouquiniste you\'\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don\'\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'\'ll quickly find what you\'\'re looking for in the Author\'\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.

Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? Whether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! From Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! The app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!

Click "...More" to learn why you should download this App today!*** Featured In New and Newsworthy! ***Do you love to read? With iBouquiniste you\'\'ll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they\'\'re still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones "What you see is what you get" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. iBouquiniste Features Include:* Supports notes* Send books by email* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them* Real page numbers* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)* OPDS catalogs support* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)The interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don\'\'t do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that\'\'s not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!Tired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you\'\'re not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That\'\'s why this app also features a unique Author\'\'s Library and a Favorites Library.If you\'\'re in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you\'\'ll quickly find what you\'\'re looking for in the Author\'\'s Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. Have you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you\'\'ve read something else? Who hasn\'\'t done that? The problem is that when you\'\'re ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can\'\'t remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with "Recent". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you\'\'ve finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It\'\'s as easy as sending an email right from the app!Don\'\'t let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading.
